{"data": [{"text": "Okay , welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group . Um  I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally ,\nSorry .\nso uh . Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . Um and that people might want it as as  in addition to their existing remote controls . Um  and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um mm uh use it . And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost . Um .  Now uh uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um  the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . Um and and then we'll  as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh  Anyway . Okay . Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh  I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer  they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um  the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . Um now this doesn't  necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . Um it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that  we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway . Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um mm  uh is is is their choice , but uh um we we need to talk that through . Um okay , so uh after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh\num notes sent out and uh etcetera . Okay , so  we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . Um again I   there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to  who who who thinks they would like to go go first ?", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "controls, design, remote, illuminated, switching", "dialogue_id": 0}, {"text": "Uh I don't mind .\nP fine .\nUh can I steal the cable ?\nOh sorry , you can indeed .\nCheers .\nI got a  how do I start there ?\nOh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . That one .\nThat one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the  our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um  everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are  how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly  . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um  they they don't uh  they , yeah , they only use  they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh  I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour .  Uh again , seventy five percent is  seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just  they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume  .  And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like  well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the  uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very  aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control .\nMm .\nI dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate  , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is  Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new  like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use  have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice  the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable .\nMm .\nMaybe don't even have to hold it as such .\nGosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say .\nBut uh yeah . It also asked um if we would  if people would pay more for speech recognition\nand younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our  on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were ,\nMm . Right . Mm .\nso .  May be incrementally emitting , but yeah .\nYeah , I must say that um the uh  I c can't remember what  um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought\nAnd uh  it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you\nand it it cuts out uh  I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ ,\nj just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry .\nYeah , um  oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost  no ? It's  sorry it's a bit  . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ?\nYeah .\nWhereas channel selection , which is very high relevance\nMm-hmm .\nis used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on  or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings ,\nMm .\nwhich are low relevance\nMm-hmm . I mean\nand rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily\nIt could be  oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ?\nMm .\nHave you seen the new mo mobile phones\nYeah .\nthat flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side ,\nOh yeah .\nso\nMm .\nyou could have the most  used buttons on top and flip it out or something .\nHmm , hmm .\nMm .\nYeah , like the one that like slides back\nUh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ?\nand the buttons are concealed underneath .\nYeah .\nMm .\nIf people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um  remove them altogether .\nJust remove them completely ?\nWe we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um\nThat might be the\nI wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the   Um now the the age structure we were looking at  um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they\nUh yeah .\nForty  no sorry  for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent .\nYes we\nUm no this is for  pay more for speech recognition .\nThat would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at  um well again , we don't know the relative proportion  the relative numbers in the age groups .\nYeah , that's true .\nIf we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it .\nP Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change .\nBut if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_\nIt might\nOr even  I mean you could even just have it left on .\nMaybe i\nYou could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to\nYeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box\nand have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are ,\nMm .\nyou won't lose it .\nYeah .\nIt c well it  I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television ,\nMm .\nNo .\nbecause if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself ,\nB_B_C_ one .\nYeah .\nOh .\nYeah .\nso it probably needs to be um  possibly actually need a button on it\nYeah , that's true .\njust to activate it .\nOh yeah .\nOr or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then\nYeah .\nuh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different .  Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there ,  would people miss them ?\nMm-mm .\nBut look at the importance of them . The volume settings .\nRelevance of two out of ten ,\nVol volume ,\nyeah .\nYeah .\nyes um\nThey're not used often\nth\nbut they are quite important when they're used .\nw we need to s identify things that  people actually need\nYeah .\nand and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume\nMm .\nand th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that\nYeah .\nuh would appear to be essential .\nStand out .\nUm . So  if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's  the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option .\nUh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt .\nDo , please .\nUh you were saying about um it could  technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed\nMm-hmm .\nwe could maybe have like an activation word .\nYou cer certainly could .\n'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just  you address the remote ,\nDepe uh i depends whether um\nMm .\nyou address the computer , and then give it a command .\nif we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say\nOh I see . Oh yeah , I see .\nB_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print  actually print it on the uh\nMm-hmm , yeah .\ndevice itself . Um .\nI mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote .\nS th this I th  that's always gonna be a problem I think .\nMm .\nUm and I I I s so I suppose one um  could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one .\nAnyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with\nOh no\nor\nI I interrupted you ,\nno no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there .\nsorry  . Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah ,\nMm okay .\nI was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the  or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much .  alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since  if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd  it would be fashion and fashion over practicality .\nMm-hmm . S s we could  we could make it dual function  voice recognition and  still have buttons on it um\nOh , we could , yeah . We c yeah ,\n'cause we're\nwe could even have it as like a  yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so .\nCertainly could . Yeah , yeah .\nMm .\nSo uh yeah , if we could uh  power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really\nThe  I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper .\nYeah and probably it would look better as well .\nNo , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive .\nYeah . yeah .\nUm 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box .\nMm .\nLined with numbered buttons and\nMm , yeah . Okay , who  sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ?\nUh yeah , yeah , that's everything .\nYep , yep . Um  given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh   .\nOkay well , I can do mine .\nHmm .\nDo you want the cable ?\nYeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um .\nOh , you have to hit like function and F_ something .\nOh .\nF_ eight .\nF_ eight .\nIs it doing\nDunno .\nUh , give it about twenty seconds , or so .\nOkay .\nAh , there we go .\nOh yeah , it's going .\nOh okay .  Okay , so this is just about the technical functions .\nAlright .\nSo the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are  what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be .\nMm-hmm .\nSo these are the two different ones . This one um  this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons\nand then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons ,\nMm-hmm .\nand probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you  it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a  you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top ,\nMm , yeah .\nthen that would be easier . Um  and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was  when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it  maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remotes, remote, cable, displays, controls", "dialogue_id": 0}, {"text": "Okay , can I um  I'm actually gonna use the um  it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . I'm actually gonna use the\nF they probably clip to you .\nOh yeah , they might be movable .\nYeah .\nOh yeah , they're all  they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em .\nYes , rather than the uh the the traditional  in fact , um I won't even go that far . Um something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can  that's sort of a more vertical shape , um that you you sort of hold in your hand , um , well I'm trying to think uh uh uh l uh l such as  I mean um something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the uh the infrared or whatever source .\nMm .\nUh so that you know , it's flying off in all directions ,\nMm .\nso that uh um uh  again the  n need to look at the the the technicalities of um actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh  such a source , um you know , compromise the  our our need for uh you know , it it being um mm permanently uh you know , available .\nUh whether whether different technology  um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , um you know , short range , not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . Um\nbut uh uh I think basically i if we're going for  i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . Um and nothing else .  Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , but again , except that um  you know the risk of losing it . Um anyway okay um so Kate , wh what are your uh your thoughts on this ?\nYes , mm .\nOh .\nWhich one does this plug into ?\nHmm I think it's all there .\nThat one .\nH\nI can't  did you   could you see it on you screen when it\nOh yeah .\nThat's not cool .\nThat's kind of strange .\nOh well . Anyways . Um alright , yeah , so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh .  Oh there we go . Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever .\nUm and it does this uh by  well , you need  to start off you need an energy source  and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is  that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um  Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source ,  uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . And um  oops . Uh-huh . This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . Uh this just kinda represents the energy source\nHmm .\nwhich feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um  a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between  so it'll light up once we start  once you start pressing buttons . Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually   what ? Sends signals to the the television . And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there .\nAnd so my personal preferences  I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface  um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . And that's pretty much it .\nOkay . Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um\nMm .\nI think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one .\nMm .\nUm I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . Um given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing .\nUm perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one  some sort of typical usage . You know , the the the battery will last know , five , ten years . By which time  I mean when all's said and done , the digital television  will be taking over in that time scale . Um\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nuh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh\nJust having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ?\nYeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one .\nOh , cool .  Yeah , fair enough .\nUm it's , you know , it's  what it saves in cost and you know there there's a  well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it\nIt could have like uh  know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time .\nYeah .\nMm , mm .\nAre are people really gonna use it though ? Um .\nYeah , people are pro\nI suppose , yeah .\nMm yeah\nI would think that people might forget\nI I th I think\nI mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there ,\nMm-mm .\nso .\nYeah , it's\nYeah .\num  I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge\nMm .\nand then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . Um .\n'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies .  And that's pretty much\nYeah .\nWhen it  yeah , wh when it's died is a problem .\nyeah . Yeah , when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in ,\nYeah , yeah , yeah ,  so uh um\nyeah .\nwhat so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ?\nYeah , think that's a good idea .\nNo .\nUh . That sounds pretty good , yeah .\nIs the uh  you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here .\nUm .\nMm .\nUm you know , cut cost within the manufacturing and uh you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective .\nDo they make batteries that last that long ?\nI mean th th certainly . Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head ,\nThey usually have the little light uh  source ,\nbut there are certainly things that you buy . I mean calculators for example .\nI dunno what the heck they're called ,\nYeah , they have that little solar\nthe  but\nSom well some do ,\nyeah , the little cells that\nI mean th th but there are battery ones\nYeah .\nthat um are you know , sort of permanently sealed .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nIn in fact I'd\nYeah .\nMost of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light ,\nYeah ,\nand if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery ,\nuh uh\nso we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it .\nMm .\nYeah , I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit .\nMm .\nI mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating\nMm .\nI would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . Um .\nOh , it depend if it's  uh depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking ,\nYeah , some people are\nIf , but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market\nyeah . Yeah ,  then they're clicking a lot , yeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nW\nn\nlike like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight\nPer hour ?\nRight .\ntimes per hour .\nYeah .  Yeah .\nYeah .\nWow .  That's a lot .\nOh , I must admit I hadn't um  I'd I'd missed that . That does sound excessive .\nBut then again , if you think it  of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like\nYeah .\nThat's  it's less than a second , um .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nWell that's right , and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed ,\nMm .\nor whether it's just a\nYeah .\nsorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . Um .\nThough I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that ,\nYeah .\nMm .\nso you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nchannels that way instead of\nMm .\nRight , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared .

We're looking at extreme simplicity . We're looking at a radically different shape . Possibly no buttons at all um , but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . Um in the  I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint .

You just coloured it .\nUh s Final design .  Basically in   what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here .\nMm-hmm . I like the menu .\nWe chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad .\nMm-hmm .\nIf you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast .\nAnd I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose .\nSo  Probab\nI think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to\nYeah . That's the be\nHmm .\nAnd it  I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber\nYeah , of course .\nthan to uh\nThat's uh the integration story again .\nMm yeah . Okay .\nSo we have it's a bit round shaped ,\nOh yeah .\nthat's what we had uh  We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute .\nMm-hmm .\nSo that's basically what we chose there .\nOkay .\nIf you have anything to add , please interrupt me .\nNo , uh this is just a description of what we see there .\nYeah .\nSo\nOh .\nSpeaks for itself .\nYeah .\nThat's pretty much it .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "prototype, buttons, design, menu, button", "dialogue_id": 1}, {"text": "Okay . Now it's my time to ruin everything . Well , not ruin everything , but  no , nah .\nOh sorry .\nFinances , that's what we have here , what you drew . We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh  for speak recognition anyway . So which  you see the  which is de o one of the most expensive parts . So  well , we have sin one curve ,  a design . Rubber design . And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . So just half a Euro for   You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost ,\nHmm .\nwhich is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . So ,\nHmm .\neasy . What do we scrap . Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .\nI d\nI'd say that too .\nYeah .\nBecause the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side .\nHmm .\nThere are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . I think it's also harder to\nUh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample ,\nYeah .\nwhich you can't do with a normal remote control ,\nHmm .\n. So I ju\nwhich people already do . So\nI took that out . So  and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . And , yeah , I didn't see anything else I could take out . Yeah , I could take out the push-buttons ,\nPushbut\nbut we need those . So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition\nHuh .\nSpecial colour , yeah .\nand the separate covers can account for the  if people want it , we'll just  then we'll do it in black . We'll just deliver it in black , have the  it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it  if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .\nWell ,\nYou make it d orange or whatever you want .\nI'd  I tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this .\nIt was a big issue , but\nSo can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ?\nI'll just go back . Uh let's just  let's see what  okay , let's just see what we  no , we we have to be under twelve and a half .\nYeah , it\nIt  it's not\nThe p\nuh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half ,\nOkay , but there's another problem .\nAnd the p\nso .\nOkay .\nBut there's another problem .\nWhat\nIf we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously .\nI think you  that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together .\nHuh . Huh . Yeah .\nSo I think  yeah , it's  I think it's y one of the  it's a good way to um to help people uh to make  to keep the product trendy too .\nHmm .\nJust keep  you just make new covers for the  for it ,\nHmm .\nlike we agreed before .\nRight . I agree .\nAnd everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . But we need that for the L_C_D_ display .\nYeah . We do .\nMm-hmm .\nThen again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . B yeah , but those go together . And yeah , we could take out the curve .\nOr say let's lose rubber , take plastic .\nWe could take out a curve indeed .\nCould  we could take out the curve . Is that an option ?\nYes .\n.\nFor you ?\nAlthough we are demolishing a little bit the style .\nBut uh the  and\nI think the colour is more important than the really the curve ,\nYeah .\nBut\nbecause if you just end up with an entirely black remote control\nI think it's  it it does ruin it ,\nYeah . The people\nbut the fact that I t took that decision or t\nYeah .\nTook this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um  the possibility of adding your own custom covers . So you can change  any colour you want . So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want .\nCan we then not also uh change the material ? We take plastic for the basic cover\nYou can take plastic ,\nand\nbut I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that  something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of  the spongy feeling of the\nSpongy , yeah .\nWe can put those to the to the other covers .\nand it really makes it  also makes it different from the existing remote controls ,\nYeah .\nbecause they're all plastic .\nAnd\nSo which in in turn\nThat's true .\nRubber would increase durability\nBut\nbecause it doesn't break .\nokay . But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? Because we have to lose two things and  I guess .\nI al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour ,\nBut\nYes .\nwhich would make this black a black and grey .\nOkay , and that's enough ?\nYeah , that's that that that's enough , because\nSo black and grey is okay .\nI guess those are the basic colours .\nBut\nSo  Oh .\nWhich we can fabricate ,\nHmm .\nI think those are basic col They want to\nokay .\nThe people want to pay for for it , so why why uh  do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ?\nTo ensure the profit . That  that's th that's the order . We're just uh  we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company\nYeah .\nwhich say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this .\nBut we can take a risk .\nBut that's not for our  that's not our decision to take . We have a budget of twelve fifty per product .\nNo , we basically\nOkay , yeah .\nHmm .\nSo\nWe need to stick to that .\nStick that . I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we we have the the backup of  or the backup design thing\nI hope the people will like it ,\nto have\nbut\nI think they would do . Th I think they do like because yo we  you  we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea ,\nbecause p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want .\nYeah .\nSo I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect\nPerhaps we should make m\nYeah .\nand keep the functionality between  of  within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget .\nHuh .\nThe first sheet .\nSo\nPerhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . And that's  uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that .\nWell I don't think  Yeah . Is it worth  is it is it\nPerhaps they decide tha\nBut they don't\ndoes it mean anything to the customer ? Like , it  like , we don't care  we don't care that you had to\nOf course . Perhaps  they uh  no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let's  that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs .\nTrue ,\nWe ca we uh we can at least tell them that\nbut we did we didn't get that . So I think it's\nYou don't know that .\nit should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something .\nWell\nHuh .\nBut\nNo , I'm not uh talking about that cost  but the one that g has given us the order to design this . We could at least m uh make it like this , like you said ,\nThey could , but uh\nand then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an  still an option , but  not for this price .\nIt's an option , but  yeah , it's true . So actually uh it's not that much of an increase , but yeah . We cannot contact them .\nAnd if we\nIt's just the order that we got .\nExactly ,\nSo that's what we gotta go with .\nbut\nYeah .\nSo it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it's either  turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable ,\nYeah .\nHmm .\num or turn it yellow . So   It's uh something we have to decide on .\nI'd say lose the curve and the colour\nI say lose the curve . Oh that's true ,\nand\nwe could lose the c I forgot that , yeah , sorry . Uh the curve . So\nSo which curve is that ba\nThat's just this one just d this is the banana curve .\nthat's basically that curve .\nHmm .\nSo this would this would be straight .\nSo we could u still have the comfort .\nYeah , that's better .\nNo , uh  no , that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . No , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like  like that .\nHmm .\nWhich would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary .  we could make it yellow then ,\nI second that .\nbut  You second that , you second that we lose the curve .\nNo , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control .\nOkay , yeah .\nSo that's not really that\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve  to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak .\nHmm .\nSo we keep the curve . So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber .\nI would\nAnd I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .\nOh . I agree .\nYeah . I would say  I would agree with you on the colour ,\nNo .\nYep .\nbecause that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money .\nMm-hmm . Yeah , um\nSo we can always do that .\nI guess people are willing to pay for that . So I think we can take that option and just  with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control .\nHmm ?\nYeah .\nSo I think that would still make it a nice product .\nYes .\nOkay , we're final on that . So  it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . But anyways we're here .

That's just now  just  we could just discuss how the project went .

We didn't  I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time .

I mean I suppose this sells , because it's very   very extended .\nUm\nBut\nWell I hope it sells .\nLet's  Uh\nI suppose it sells ,\nHmm .\nbecause it's good .\nOh .\nI mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway .\nHmm .\nHmm . Okay , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . Um I have some   uh a method , a requirements and scale of . I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what  if it's true or false\nOkay .\nand uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not .\nHave been met , okay .\nAnd I will uh make a new blank sheet\nYeah .\nSo so the buttons , the look and feel . I thought it was okay , but the advanced uh settings , um screen , audio and channel\nThey're stuck under menu .\nWhich are basically accessible through the menu button .\nWe are not\nFor the menu . I think those are totally met ,\nHmm .\nbecause we we really took them for the  they have the feel they want ,\nOh the menu button is it .\nYeah .\nHi Oh , okay .\nthey have the simplicity they want .\nThen it's all uh  S\nI think it's very uh very well met . Either two or one maybe .\nOne .\nit's true .\nI think we took that  everything they wanted into consideration .\nYeah .\nSo it could either be a two or a one .\nSo d Oh wait . Uh pen .\nOne and a half .\nWhich is not an option .\nThe p Oh yeah ,\nJust create our own option .\nit's red , okay , but  Look and feel is everybo it's true .\nYeah .\nSo  Anyone ? And the next one  uh  yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it .\nIt's perfect . Even for deaf people , yeah .\nIt's\nIt's  I don't think it's perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back .\nHmm .\nTo make it that way , yeah .\nBecause if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light . Maybe you can hear it . But I mean we tried ,\nYeah .\nso I think it  that's  that deserves a one . Definitely .\nAnd it's and it's  yeah . To  . That's okay then . And the next one . How is that ? Uh w we had  we don't have an uh manual ,\nManual .\nyeah .\nI think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control ,\nBut I think that's a part of it . But\nI'd use an  remote control .\nMm yeah .\nbut then again , it's for young people . So\nYeah , an L_C_D_ , it tells a lot about uh\nAnd it's pretty straight-forward ,\nYeah , I th\nIt's pretty straight-forward , uh-huh .\nyou have a navigation  no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus .\nExactly . No , that's true . I think it won't be a big problem .\nYeah .\nSo\nSo it's a one\nOne I d no ,\nor a   I don't know .\nactu\nI think  but we didn't even\nFor the advanced uh settings .\nthere was no issue on making a manual actually . We didn't   really discuss it ,\nNo okay , that  uh that's true .\nbut I don't think it takes  no , it really does doesn't take time to learn , I think . We took it s it's so easy ,\nNo , it it is pretty straight-forward .\nOh , so it\nwe have so little button , everything speaks for itself really . So I think that's\nAh . Um\nyeah , we didn't  it's either two or one , I guess .\nTakes no ti\nMaybe it's a two , because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is  there are some option hidden under the menu button .\nWith the more important functions on .\nYeah .\nSo I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess .\nYeah . Yeah .\nAnd the L_C_D_ , you have to see it .\nSo just make that a two .\nUm mm  Oh , it's a little bit learning . Okay . Uh yeah  it's uh a little bit same .\nMm-hmm .\nBut it tells you or not ?\nYou can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . I think so . I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . I think so .\nBut wha w\nMm-hmm .\noh , yeah . What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? Just uh only the channels and  or\nthe menus uh  Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu ,\nWhat uh ?\nbecause we have no buttons for those .\nWell , basically the menu options indeed . But\nOh , in the L_C_D_ screen .\nNo , y I mean in the L_C_D_ screen , the small screen . What does it display ?\nYes .\nAnd for a channel selection , uh   or that's not\nWell I thought it was I thought it was  I thought that people wanted previews on their  I'm not sure if that even possible ,\nYeah , I thought I thought too\nbut\nbut\n'cause it's  this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width .\nyeah .\nI don't think it's possible really . But the  they didn't really define in what should be used for .\nNo .\nMaybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ uh\nBut I think in for example like T_V_ guides , I think that's  that th that you can transmit through it and everything . Just for extra information on your programmes .\nMm .\nYeah . Yeah , it must be clear then what  what what for we use it .\nBut also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your  uh with configuring your remote control for favourite  your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo that could be done by L_C_D_ display . I think it's good . No , maybe it's not a one because it's  we're not using it perfectly . We didn't give it  I don't thing over-discussing . Now we gave it enough thought though . I think we d should just lower this .\nYeah .\nMaybe maybe it's a three though . We could've used it more effectively probably .\nYeah , indeed .\nSo everybody's agree with an uh three on it ,\nYeah , we are using it ,\nYeah . Two or three .\nYes .\nit's\nbut it's not\nW\nit's not poorly used , but it's not efficiently used , I think .\nSo\nYeah .\nWe could have ev even lost  the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection .\nYeah .\nIt's  now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features ,\nYeah ,  I\nbut okay .\nA three .\nNah , it's not really  only an extra .\nYou can  seven .\nNo menus .\nAh , nothing , that's   A seven . Uh that's uh\nThink about\nCan you talk to remote control ?\nOr we could say it\nWell , it can't talk anymore . So we scrap that .\nYeah .\nOr we could say neutral ,\nOh yeah\nwe  'cause we scratched the\nJust to be a prick ,\nC\nbut of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything .\nYeah yeah yeah yeah .\nBut you c  you can talk to it .\nNot with the speech recognition . Uh yeah , all the trends and no colours uh anymore . So\nWell , we did take everything into consideration of course . Uh the shape i shape is i\nYeah ,   uh um only in the curves .\nI think we  yeah , I think that's okay .\nBut the colours , we don't have special colours on it .\nNo , we don't have the colour .\nYeah ,  special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable\nSo I\nYeah ,\nto the fashi\nbut we\nYes , but the end product  So\nHmm .\nyeah , we don't have it , so d\nWe don't have it  we do have it ,\nIn the end product .\nit's just sold as a package .\nBut  M\nIt does  it's not part of the basic product .\nChanging covers is also trend that we followed .\nIt  that that's what I call trendy . I mean the shape is trendy .\nThe the sh the the functions are trendy . It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . Because you ha\nNow\nit's just not affordable at the moment .\nMaybe we should go with a two then ,\nBut it's not a one .\nbecause it's not perfect , because we can't do it initially ,\nYeah .\nbut we\nIt's possible ,\nMm-hmm .\nOh .\nbut you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour .\nOh well  Oops .\nOh it's a two ,\nYeah .\nright ?\nMm-hmm .\nOn the last one . Uh that n that's all .\nOverall score .\nOverall score .\nOverall .  It's um\nOne two three .  sixteen .\nten , sixteen three  uh two\nTwo two point some two point something .\ntwo point seven or something like that .\nHmm .\nI don't know why .\nTen , sixteen , divided by\n.\nSix .\nSix .\nIs two two third .\nTwo and two thirds .\nUm  So\nwe can say it's it's  the product is  it's okay .\nIt's okay , but  that's yo m\nY not\nMm-hmm .\nmostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition .\nThere's\nMm-hmm .\n'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average .\nYeah .\nWithout that it would be like under  it wouldn't  yeah , it would be under two . So I think we have  even with this it's reasonable .\nWoah .\nYeah , if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we   that it's really not well implemented . We come out on a average of two one eighth .\nYeah .\nWell I think it's  two is okay .\nSo which is pretty w good .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , two is pretty good .\nIt's at least on the positive side .\nDefinitely .\nSo  We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources ,\nHmm , of course .\nYeah .\nbut\nYeah , I think it's probably   I\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "finances, designing, consideration, design, spent", "dialogue_id": 1}, {"text": "I do admit that we d  did miss a little  or didn't sp didn't talk   talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display .

Yeah .\nSo that's the final product without the speakers , I guess .\nSo did you\nLet's see , what was left in the the  Another one .  Hmm .  Yeah ,\nwe evaluate the product .   General project , what's i in  For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere .\nHmm .\nFavourite channel .\nWell  Anyways . Yeah , leadership is up to you . I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d  put a put a speech recognition into it . But that's not for me to decide .\nYeah , I know . Yeah .\nI think we did pretty well as team-work though . Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime ,\nYes . Hmm .\nbecause when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you .\nHmm .\nYeah , you're working separate .\nYeah .\nSay , look , this is  you're doing the wrong thing ,\nYeah .\nHuh .\nyou're s you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nYeah , yeah yeah .\nSo it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh\nHmm .\nYeah yeah yeah . Direct uh communication with  yeah .\nbecause that's that's what would w you  what you would normally do , either call or email someone .\nAnd we could share information which we received .\nSo that was too bad\nHmm .\ncon was impossible here anyways .  .\nThat's the same thing that I had in the beginning . Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have .\nIt didn't have\nSo\nor didn't knew what they costs or whatever .\nYeah .\nThere was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them .\nOh .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nSo that was a little unclear I suppose . I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little  it's easier to share them .\nMy handwriting is little bit  yeah . Yeah .\nAlthough for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher ,\nHmm .\nIt's a little less  it  the response time is le it's very bad .\nbecause\nHmm .\nIt's good to visualise everything , but I think the response time should  could be a lot better .\nThe digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that .\nBut th that's\nDefinitely .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , it's true .\nYeah , okay .\nSo\nBut there's uh also one problem with this I noticed .

No , you don't .\nNo .\nI jin I didn't check the finish button .\nOh .\nYou can\nI just  you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever .\nDone and then it's okay .\nOkay , I saw that uh\nUh only if you uh check the notes or  press done .

And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further .\nOkay , before starting a ne a new page .\nOkay .\nOkay , that could be b .\nExactly . So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible .\nOh .\nOkay .\nYou have to finish it completely ,\nHmm .\nOh can you ? Okay .\nthen download it , it's  then start a new one .\nYeah , okay .\nThat's not very uh handy ,\nThat's\nbut if you know that , then it's not a problem .\nYeah , it's understandable , okay .  Any new ideas ? Yeah , more communication between  between uh  that's the thing I noticed , that communication is very um very important ,\nImportant to mm\nbecause if you get new information , it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making  doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical   on the d on the design side .\nYeah .\nSo I think that could have been better .

Uh\nI want one for my own .\nI'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what  all your tasks were finished , right ? What you ha from your assistant .

It's better than thi I think than a serial number . Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me . Uh\nJust\nOr fruit name .\noh , think of a catchy name . I'll be working on this until the beep  until it beeps . So\nLike fruit names .\nFruit name or something like that .\nWhat ? Fruit ?\nThe banana remote or something .\nYou don't want it to resemble a banana .\nI don't know .

It should be it should be longer , because it's not a product name that you f print on a box .\nI think  triple R_ .\nJust write out triple , like a word triple R_C_ , triple stripe  Oh .

The triple R_C_ , yeah .\nYeah .\nR_ s R_ three C_ .  .\nR_ dash C_ .\nDash C_ ?\nI think I like it like this more .\nDash .

Uh I think that the the R_C_ together takes away the the the image of  it's a triple\nHmm .\nUh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control ,\nMm .\nThat\nbut it's only a single remote control .

I have some instructions now to do that .\nYeah .\nUh well you know how to  the documents work . So  Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform .\nYes .\nOperations .\nSo\nIt doesn't always work . Yes .\nYeah .\nOkay so you can draw .\nDraw . Alright .\nOkay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . Okay ?\n'Kay .\nUh  Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal . Uh you should explain  Uh with different colours and with different pen widths .\nAnd you should explain why you draw that particular animal .\nOkay .\nDon't take up too much space .\nSo , Julian .\nUm yeah .\nDifferent pen widths , how do you do that ?\nUh with the format menu .\nOh okay .\nAnd use different colours etcetera .\nIt's a giraffe . Yeah .\nAnd  what's that supposed to be ?\nAre you serious ?\nShould it be one\nOh yeah .  Oh yeah\nOkay .\nfour legs . Uh-huh .\nGiraffe's yellow .\nUh it needs some uh some yellow uh  Oh format .\nCan you use one blank sheet per drawing ?

Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal ?\nYeah .\nI think it's a it's a great animal .\nWhat is it ?\nIt's a it's a giraffe .\nA giraffe okay . Yeah I see a long neck\nYeah , that's a\nbut\nIt's more like a dinosaur .\nUm  Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye .\nOkay . That's nice of you .\nUh .\nHey . Come on .\nSome leaf to eat .\nOkay .

Your line broke .\nYeah . Alright .\nYeah it's a bit slow ,\nIt's not that fast .\nso\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI see . It misses the spot .\npressure .\nI'm guessing a turtle . No .  I'm kidding .\nI say good guess . Uh\nWhy a turtle ?\nBecause of its shell .\nBecause it's slow .\nIt's slow .\n'Cause it's so\nYou were slow too\n'cause it's green .\nso\nYeah I was a bit slow too .\nDude you're a good drawer .\nSo   Uh some other line uh width uh\nDo you have a turtle pet ?\nNo .\nUh okay .\nI dunno .  Does it have legs ?\nYeah yeah yeah .\nYeah sure .\nYeah ?\nYeah not exactly legs but  More like fins\nStumpy stuff .\nor\nIt's more like a tank . Yeah that's fins\nThey kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on .\nbut I don't know where .\nYeah .\nSome spots . Ah some eye .\nYeah\nit's l looks very friendly .\nYeah that's a fr  friendly turtle I guess .\nYeah well I think it's uh fair enough .\nYeah okay .\nA little tail maybe .\nRight .  I don't know what the position is .  Does it have ears ?\nUh no .\nNo .\nNo .\nNo . Oh okay .\nThe little holes maybe .\nCan you erase ears\nYeah yeah yeah .\nor\nThere's a a gum ,\nYeah ? Alright .\ngum to  .\nEraser .\nAnd why did you choose this animal ?\nSo\nHe said it was slow .\nI dunno . I it just came into my mind . So there's no particular reason\nAlright .\nI  pen .\nI like it .\nYeah . Well I'm  guess I'm done .\nOkay .\nThat's my turtle .\nYour turn Niels .\nAlright .\nHow to select the next or\nThe next\nhere .\nyeah .\nColours were under format\nYeah .\nMakes new paper .\nHere you go .\nYeah .\nright ?

Yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay so the um  uh  this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ?\nTrue .\nOkay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . Right ? Yeah ?\nYep .\nAnd the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements .\nYeah .\nUh did any of you already do some work on this part or\nWell I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nSo I had to uh ,  I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do ,\nMm-hmm .\nand kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it .\nMm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?\nWell I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said .\nMm-hmm .\nHow does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points . Uh  according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ .\nMm-hmm .  Okay .\nAnd that's basically all I have so far .\nYeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .\nYeah . Wireless uh  huh .\nYeah .\nAlright .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo that's very common .\nUh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the  to all the channels and changing the volume . That are the the basic options for a remote control .\nYeah . Yeah I kept it global 'cause   that it activates or deactivates specific functions ,\nOkay , yeah .\n'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel\nYeah .\nbut you might wanna use teletext also .\nYep .\nYeah .\nI dunno what the word is in English . Uh\nSame I believe  .\nYeah .\nUh and what did the Marketing Expert do ?\nUh well from a marketing uh  perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements .\nMm-hmm .\nUm what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research  uh to see what existing products are there out in the market .\nMm-hmm .\nI mean , what functions do they have .\nMm .\nUm especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUm therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ?\nYep . Yes .\nSo we can see uh what needs to be supported . Um  and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users ,\nOkay . Okay .\nuh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first ,\nMm-hmm .\nand they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add .\nOkay .

That is my question also\nYeah .\nbecause like new new functions\nWell I think that is the user requirements part .\nRequirements . Yeah .\nAs to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small\nYeah . True .\nYeah .\nBut but we need good communication about this stuff ,\nUnit .\nYeah .\n'cause I have to f put the components into the design .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nI would first m\nSo if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard .\nYeah well\nYeah I understand .\nI I was\nYeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them .\nYeah\nYou can always add a few\nwell like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices .\nYeah .\nSo you can switch to your video\nHmm ,\nand then the same buttons control your video .\nthe C_D_ player . Yeah .\nYeah .\nAnd another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular .\nYeah so\nAnd then use your Windows media centre  under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nYeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player .\nS\nMm-hmm .\nYou need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function .\nYeah\nOkay .\nAnd you you don't need that for a T_V_ .\nrecords and stuff like that .\nAnd and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well ,\nNo .\nYou need additional  yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nso I kind of need to know what we uh need .\nYeah .\nUh\nYeah .\nWhatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here\nYeah .\nand then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting .\nIn the project uh\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWe could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features .\nOkay .\nSo we have a basic starting point\nOkay .\nand you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah .\nYeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly .\nAlright .\nYeah .\nSo it's hasn't   it's  yeah .\nTh the least amount of functions possible\nYeah .\nso it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera .\nOkay .

Appendix .\nYeah , this is  .\nSee there's a role for everybody .\nYeah , that's right ,\nEven for the marketing .\nfirst  .  us user define .\nNext  .\nBut look at your role , your marketing role .\nThere's a trend watching .\nI don't know .\nYeah , that's your role .\nI  .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "roles, interface, role, responsibilities, designs", "dialogue_id": 3}, {"text": "Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done\nand what are your ideas about the\nAbout the design or  Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ?\nWell , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess .\nMm-hmm .\nSo we have to  plan how how it would be developed and uh\nMm .\nYeah .\nhow we can make it work  .\nYes .\nI mean working remotes we already have . This will be something different from the other remotes  remote controls .\nWhat we we have to keep in mind the  these characteristics .\nYeah , I dunno I\nAnd of course it should not be very costly .\nYeah , that's right .\nSo\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWell I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or\nNeed to collect information .\nYeah .\nAbout the  about what ?\nUm .  I I'm part of design , perhaps . Uh , what is most important in a  in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ? Uh .\nYou mean the external  or\nWell , you have to make it work .\nYeah of g of course .\nThat's alright .\nThat's the  that's the big thing .\nYeah , it should be easy to work with .\nYeah  .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWe can think about an interface with uh well\nUh . We  maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . You just tell the television I want  which channel .\nYou won't\nOr or you can say for example , um   I want uh to list all the programme tonight . Y you know  , instead of  uh remote control it's doing the  some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . Just say maybe I just want to press  I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . Or a button for all the magazines , all the information  documentary tonight . And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful .\nYeah , yeah .\nI I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly .\nNo , because  no ,\nS\nit's not very  a lot . Th this information exists . For example you can get um\nLike s uh you you you say we can use speech .\nYou can use uh  well for example  anything .  The  the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah .\nI  I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno\nI'm a  okay .\nYeah . Yeah .\nI mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand\nIn the hand .\nand we should be very careful about the size of the remote control .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nIf we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with  trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog\nYeah . Yes , possible .\nif you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it .\nYeah . But\nYeah .\nAnd I could talk to the T_V_  television itself .\nExcept if if you are far from the T_V_ .\nI need not have an\nYeah .\nI mean we have some  or something , different technology but\nThis is  it's\nYeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme .\nOn the content .\nMm-hmm , yeah .\nYeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea\nMm-hmm .\nSo it's more powerful . Yeah .\nbut I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to\nNo . No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . They they are  they are  they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . We don't care . We just say that this are some content . We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . Some of the websites they already provide this service ,\nYeah yeah .\nso we can just use the service available . Download it uh to the  to this remote control .\nMm .\nAnd then there's  there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . The most there are only seven buttons . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so  you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons .\nYeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons .\nYeah , yeah .\nWell I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the  Well channel programme or contents or  in an easy way , so\nThis is  good idea .\nYeah . Ah , yes . So  . Yeah . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ?\nYeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen\nGood idea  . Okay .\nand just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f\nI think I think that will be revol revolutionary  .\nBecause all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . Yeah .  Alright .\nYeah , yeah . So   I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff\nOkay .\nSo we have five minutes to\nAh w w we have sometimes to use the white-board .\nAh you can y you can you can use it if you  so , can we\nFive minutes .\nAnd another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of\nOkay . Okay .\nSo , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself .\nYeah .\nS\nYeah .\nThe lighting in the room changes .\nYeah , but we are designing just remote control .\nYou  it  .\nI mean , we have a option in the remote control . If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote .\nOkay .\nOh right so\nOkay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ?\nYeah . If if you you you can if you want you can use th the  .\nPlease , Norman , draw uh\nGo on , draw something  .  Mm .\nOh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel .\nWhere is it ?\nThe lapel .\nOr before the before the the design that says  .\nAh , okay .\nWhere where is it ? Here .\nYeah , that one .\nNorman .\nJust plug it .\nMm .\nYeah , that's right .\nBe before before writing you can uh sit and that says  what we what we said\nMm .\nthen after that you can you can use the  .

So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? We agree on that , right ?\nOkay .\nOkay .\nUh , uh first one is to uh  buttons i or it could be anything with  buttons . Uh to choose uh content s or channels .\nYeah .\nSo we have both . The user can choose w which one they want , right ?\nYeah , by content or by channel ,\nBy content or by channel .\nit's a good idea .\nChoose by contents or by channels .

Is everyone here ?\nYep .\nYep .\nOkay . This is our conceptual design meeting . And   I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . Um   I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available .\nUm we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . Um  and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons .\nUm and that they often lose the  it's easy to lose a remote . Um which were all things we were thinking we would  wanna make it simple . Um   And uh some sort of locator . Either a button or tracking device . Um  And that it should look different than what's out there . Um  Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um   Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . Um the simple versus the um the complex . The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um  Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . Have it s be something that looks different . And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um   How that would power the remote and the lamp . If we were to to have one . Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip ,  which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um  I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um   Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand .  And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also . Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . So  Marketing ?\nOkay .\nWe're watching trends .\nYep . Can I have your cable please ?\nI suppose that you can have this .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "remotes, remote, controls, buttons, design", "dialogue_id": 4}, {"text": "Thanks . Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before . Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .\nSo that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel .  Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and  Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for .  Um  we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable .\nA banana shape ?\nOh it was sort of banana shaped .\nYeah . Yeah . Right . Or with exterior designs . But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside .\nSo maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . And then the spongy feel . I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . C and look at different types of material that  might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . So that's that .\nSo possibly like a uh ,\nAlright .\nsorry , just to butt in for a second . Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?\nThat's what I was thinking yeah .\nThose like , yeah , sort of spongy ones .\nYou have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy\nYeah . So when you buy your remote you can buy\nfeel to it .  You can\nvarious coverings .\nMm various covers .\nWhat's it called ? Cust you   personalised , yeah .\nPersonalise your remote .\nWe could leave that to the cover department .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWe all know they've got nothing to do all day .\nOkay . Why can't I see the  crazy . Um yeah I  talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . Um okay . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated .\nSo , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . I have a  there is a picture  . You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . So the technology is there . Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there  has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out . And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . That is a  possibility . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . So I don't know  if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be  need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the  do it  or program all that on the control bit . And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . Um I don't  it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . Stuff like  gets more and more compli complicated . And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . And that is it . Why am I  Oh yeah . Just  .  Where are we ? Uh . Just to sort of show you . M  they've even got things like that .\nHuge things . Which is just  for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ?\nThat's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that .\nYeah . Yeah .\nNotice the giant dog bone shape ?\nDunno .\nMakes sense , makes sense .\nAnd that  yeah .\nAlso good for animals .\nYeah . See .  things  .  . Why's my screen crazy ?\nUh  Well let's see . I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior .\nJust to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . I've more information on possible materials um as well . What we can and cannot do . Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here . Okay . The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control .  The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really  top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um  So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself .  Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . Right . Pretty clear . Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . This is the circuit board from the other side . Um the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . Um you can see the circuit board itself . That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . These are the actual keys that are being pressed . They close the electric circuit . That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . That would be behind here . Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that\namplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it .  Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . And thus gives on the signal . Now this is the simple version .  Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . And not only that . Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . Um  I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . So it's pretty squishy . That would that would serve that purpose .\nSpongy ?\nUm  we could also use wood , or titanium .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remotes, remote, fashion, innovative, trends", "dialogue_id": 4}, {"text": "What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ?\nOh fya\nI don't have an information on that .

Now let's first go through the list with the materials . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these . Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . Right ? Uh a dynamo . Interestingly enough .\nUm we could use solar cells . Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really .\nMm .\nYou don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? Um solar cell is interesting .  May fail though , every here and there .\nWould you have to leave it by the window ?\nMm . Yeah\nyeah .\n.

You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work .\nSo I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . We don't need that then . Um  However our interface options are push-buttons . In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . Um  However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . And they are possible . We have an okay for scroll wheels . Okay . Um however  when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . This however may exclude certain um materials . If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . Hence we might not be able to put it in there . So um  There's also restrictions  to , when it comes to the chip . If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really .  So that's for the for the scroll wheel . Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for for that . Let's see now . Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume right ? Or is anybody still\nMm .\nYeah .\nNo I think I think batteries are probably the way to go .\nalright .\nNo . Hmm .\nAlright .\nYeah .\nUh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . Um  Um  With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . We would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much . Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions .\nWould the sort of  spongy and the the plasticky thing  y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a  it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff .\nMm . Like a covering . Yeah .\nSo I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know  in plastic . But then where do people hold it ?\nYeah .\nJust all be sort of spongy .\nThe we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it .\nSo you  as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? Like the iPod ?\nYou can have an L_C_D_ screen . Um but therefore no rubber will be used .\nRight .\nAlright ? So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . Um latex is tricky . Or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . Or wood even .\nYeah .\nUm if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine .\nYeah .\nOr make it just push-buttons . Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . Maybe not the nicest feel . Or not much originality really .\nSo the ru wait the rubbery  we can shape it however we want ? Or the rubbery we cannot ?\nWith rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it ,\n'Kay .\nbut we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen .\nMm .\nMm .\nMm .\nThat's the tricky thing .\nCould we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . So that's  thing if we did it yellow .\nYeah .\nAnd um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . They wouldn't have any  they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing .\nIs that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ?\nS Certainly can be done yes . Um yeah . if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all .\nYeah .\nLike say just the underside or so then it can be done . I assume . Yeah . So   The fruit design um  How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously ,\nMm .\nbut uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . You name it .\nMm .\nWhat about a smell ?\nJust design-wise .\nT  to the remote ?\nMm . Nice one .\nYou could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . In different ye yellows .\nBright citrus colours yeah .\nMm .\nI don't suppose we have to stick to co\nWell we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though ,\nStick to the colours yeah .\nOh yeah .\nthat's yellow and grey .\nYellow and grey .\nYellow and grey .\nSo what have we , lemon , banana , is\nMm grapefruit .\nGrapefruit .\nGrapefruit\nis what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . But  mm .\nI would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance .\nYeah .\n.\nUm\nI think having a shape could be a little ridiculous ,\nlike\nYeah .\nWell we have it banana-shaped already , kind of .\nWell we kinda do yeah .\nYeah .\nSo\nWell perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer .\nYeah .   and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour .\nAnd if it's yellow ?\nRight .\nIt's it's yellow . It's curved .\nI it's yellow .\nGrey buttons yeah .\nIt's sort of\nWell so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ?\ncouple of couple of grey stripes .\nYeah .\nWe could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over .\nOn the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey .\nIt would look like a banana just sitting on their table .\nMm .\nYeah .\nThere you go .\nRather than   rather th\nIt could  and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table ,\nOh .\nand then people would always know where it was .\nMaybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit .\nNice . Could look like a fruit bowl .\nIt could be an ape .\nCould be ,\nYeah .\nit could be an ape or a fruit bowl . we could have a variety of options here .\nYeah .\n'Kay .\nYeah .\nDo you have more to your presentation ?\nThat's pretty much it . I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on\nOh .\nthere you go .\nOkay . I'm gonna plug in here real quick . If I could .\nSure . Hang on . There you go .\nLike I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . Um  ow . Ow .\nSo is the two piece idea out ? Or have we not decided ?\nWell we sort of   rid of that because  gonna use a battery . And the base station might not be necessary .\nOh right okay .\nWell we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station ,\nYeah .\nbut just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece .\nYeah .\nMm .\nWe can still do that . However  of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much .\nMm-hmm .\nSo um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button\nMm .\ndesign which we saw there .\nMm .\nBut could be done , of course .\nOkay . Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . Probably case um material . And probably a shape also . Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . And what kind of supplements we'll have . Um   Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet .\nRight .\nAnd we have five minutes .\nOkay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be\nMm .\na cheap one .\n'Kay .\nRight ?\nSo  Um I guess we should pick the case then . If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ?\nYeah .\nWell what about what you said , like putting the\nJust\n.\njust maybe\nfinger grips just on top of the plastic ?\nyeah . Just a little bit of  .\nOkay . So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ?\nas long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes .\n'Kay . So I guess the case would be plastic , with  Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe .\n.\nYeah .\nM more of a l lamination perhaps .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ?\nYeah I think so . I think\nYeah ? Okay .\nWhich will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ?\nYes . It does .\n'Kay . So  I guess that , is that , is that about it ? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ?\nRight .\nUm okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um   Here's what's gonna be going on . Um  Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um  Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design .\nRight .\nCorrine we'll want a product evaluation . And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh\nmaybe and and get us a prototype . Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface .\nSo that  basically  just be working on the prototype ,  uh we'll accomplish your other two actions .\nAlright .  Okay .

So are we supposed to bring the little things for the\nYeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on  clip\ndo you have a belt ?\nMm .\nClip  .\nOr put 'em in your pocket , yeah .\nYeah .   okay . So my favourite animal\nYeah , what's your favourite animal ?\n'Kay um\nAh .\nIs it rude ?\nIt's an elephant .\nThat's a very good elephant .\nThe back end of an elephant .\nOh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to draw that well .\n'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal .\nUm  okay , it's big , it's got a great memory .\nDoes it ? Oh .\nSupposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets .\nMm .\nMm .\nAnd uh dunno know why but  looks like nice to me .\nOkay . Wonderful , well done .\nNice animal .\nDo you want to use the wipe  the m the wiper and wipe it off ?\nOkay .\nAnd Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ?\nAesthetic yep , sure .\nI have no idea what my favourite animal is .\n'Kay , my favourite animal ,\nuh let's see .\nOh .\nDunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before .\nIt's\nIt's a liger  ,\nNo .\nA what ?\na combination of a lion and tiger  .\nAlright .\nHave you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ?\nHow  .\nNo .\nNo .\nOh it's a hilarious movie .\nNo .\nYou have to see it . And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it .\nOkay , well done .\nGreat . Me ?\nYeah . Miss mar Miss Marketing ?\nOkay . Not quite sure how this is gonna work .\nThere  go .\nCool .  Uh  well I'll try my best  to draw . Can I just draw the face ?\nUm yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks .\nOoh . It's a cat .\nThat's a very pr pretty cat .\nWhich also has what ? A big fat body and big  and a long tail .\nOkay , do y do you wanna do some  write\nWhy ?\nyou wanna just write some words about it ?\nBecause um cuddly . And usually cats are very friendly . Usually . And they're healing as well . They heal . And they can feel when a human's got problems so\nWow , so they're kinda spiritual .\nSo , that's why I like cats .\nWell done .\nThere we are , that's me .\nOkay .\nUm , I don't actually have a favourite animal ,\nMm .\nbut for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little\nMm-hmm .\nUh . I honestly can't draw for toffee .

So it's not  you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically .\nTh that's an idea .\nYeah .\nSo you just flip them out .\nOkay .\nUm  have uh one very complicated one on one side with  all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o  one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and  minus , and the just the mute button , for example .

Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate\nYeah .\nD_V_D_ players , things like that .\nI have got  I think we should also have a back-up plan of  I  'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that  I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just  that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay . Right .\nWhat do you reckon ? See 'cause ,  I'm just thinking  bearing in mind th we've gotta  we have to have something that's cheap to make .\nYeah , I mean  . Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um\nI think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker .\nhave it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use ,\nYeah .\nuh simple to use , and looks decent and\nMay w you know , maybe even", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "remotes, controls, remote, buttons, control", "dialogue_id": 5}, {"text": "But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ?\nOr maybe even so something that's for disabled people\nI mean if it's if it's just like\nor so people that uh b don't see very well or  big buttons for  touchy buttons for\nSorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOr just one that looks really fucking cool .\ncertain certain demographic\nMm-hmm .\nCould be really light or , I dunno , something special .\nYeah , no I think you're right .

Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but  that's not gonna happen .\nI think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this  well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and  ooh , the telephone's  the television switched on or something .

Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations .  Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time .

Um we're down to the prototype presentation .\nTa-da .\nAlright .\nOver to you .\nRight .\nWell .\nOoh , two .\nYeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough .\nAh .\nThis is the one that I made .\nUh-huh .\nIt is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter  takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television  . I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance .\n'Kay .\nAnd it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there .\nOkay .\nUm as for what it's actually made of  well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right  in the different menus .\nOkay .\nUh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ?  Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just  if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nwhich is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design .\nAlso with on off switch and infrared   uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . So like uh  well , I dunno , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one  or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the  uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it .  Uh material  yeah , that's what I have to say about material . Can I scroll down on there and see what else\nMm-hmm .\nWell colour , I think  I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well .  So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm  yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them .\nUm well I don't have very much to add . Um the the case  oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype .\nThe the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a  quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um  the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material . Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really .\nI thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped .\nA banana .\nThis one has n banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like  yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and\nWould you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?\nHold them , you see , you know . Curvature , is it to your liking ?\nOh I see , the on-off's in the back .\nYes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it .\nIf you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all .\nAnd then you can use your thumb .\nAnd it was partly we thought the design looked better ,\nYeah .\nI could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the you know\nBreaking ,\nyeah .\noh right .  Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid .\nI like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role .\nHmm .\nYeah ,  we really like we really like that design ,\nIt's really kind of a\nI mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . Like a c like a compass point , you know ,\nMm-hmm mm-hmm .\njust up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel ,  but better .\nYeah . But it's also like texting ,\nYeah . Yeah , yeah ,\nyou don't\nHmm .\nI mean it  that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones ,\nI was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ?\nAnd it's a very simple design ,\nYeah .\nIt's texting .\nthere's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make .\nIt's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite  it looks quite different .\nHmm .\nYou know , I I d I have several  four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to\nYeah .\nyou know , this is really identifiable .\nI mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of   I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nbut we do definitely think that it's a viable option .\nOkay .

So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board . Okay . So um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close ,\nYeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials .\nlike they overlap . Mm , yeah , price .\nHmm .\nWe'll put price up at the top .\nNot that we actually know anything about it ,\nbut we can we can pretend .\nWell we will soon , unfortunately .\nUm Okay , so\nCome on .\nDid you say  ?\nNo ,  .\nUh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?\nIt depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and  which\nMm-hmm .\nI'd call these quite uh minimalist ,\nYes , a plain , simple , clean design .\nsimple and plain , but I mean I do see what   it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality ,\nMm-hmm .\nso in that respect it is quite fancy .\nI  yeah , so in that respect  I think we'll go with that respect .\nI think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic .\nYeah .\nWell we have got s trendy further down ,\nElegant .\nbut\nElegant .\nElegant .\nElegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant .\nYeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um\nlike stylish or aesthetic .\nStylish , yeah .\nYeah . Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is\nFancy .\nYeah .  N that  um\nDid you just break the pen ?\nyeah uh  the uh  is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level .\nWell d we'll just call it fancy then .\nWell okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps  and maybe we should say the yellow ? Should we go with the yellow in terms of  I think that's a really superior\nYeah , I think we n we need to\nthey're both\nthey're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that ,\nYeah .\nMm .\nbut if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black .\nYeah .\nSo what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two\nYeah .\nthat isn't  that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff ,\nAs a banana .\nso .\nI think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .\nYeah .\nAnd of the two I really like I m I like the banana ,\nThe chunk .\nbut I I do like the chunk .\nSo that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it .\nNo ,\nJust somewhere a long the scale of in between these two .\nbut I mean in terms  we have to evaluate one of them . Unless  do you guys wanna evaluate both ?\nI think between the two , somewhere between the two is true .\nYeah , I'd\nIt's more true than false , about a two .\nOkay . So we say true .  technologically innovative .\nI d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept .\nYeah .\nI think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .\nSo we'll say  we'll say uh false . Easy to use .\nVery .\nYes .\nOne ,\nMm-hmm .\nis that inappropriate ?\nYeah .\nOkay . Oh , pardon me . Um\nTrendy .\nOh yes .\ntrendy , s  and I say specifically spongy fruity .\nMm-hmm .\nWell , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific\nWe have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy .\nHmm .\nI think\nYeah , I don't really think that's gonna work ,\nyeah .\nbut\nOkay , so two ? Um\nYeah .\nExcess buttons .\nare there excess buttons ?\nNo .\nNo .\nNo .\nThat is false .\nSo that's false .\nUm  good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons .\nBetter , more intuitive buttons , yes .\nTrue . Ugly .\nNo .\nNo .\nNo .\nPeople don't respond well to ugly . Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people\nYeah , I think they're different , aren't they ?\nWell it is quite it is quite quirky I think .\nlike oh ,\nI like it .\nyeah . Yeah , I do too .\nIt could be quite a good brand , like a good little object .\nOh yeah . And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ? With the\nOh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ?\nYeah , with the energy .\nMm .\nIf it's  it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .\nYeah .\nIt is going to be kinetic ?\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nwe'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . Yeah , Uh so yes .\nYeah , but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that ,\nWell\nbut yeah .\nyou're still in the Play-Doh stage .\nYeah .\nAnything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ?\nWell I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there .\nYes , the instinct says true .\nOkay . So true one or should I go to two or three ?\nI'd put it at one I think , but  I dunno , what do you\nI would say maybe a two ,\nOkay .\n'cause we still  we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things .\nYeah , true ,\nI mean it's not just like  I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different ,\nYeah , that's not a cheap thing to get .\nit might be the  yeah , yeah , true . True .\nwhereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all  they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in .\nHmm .\nYeah , that's a good point .\nuh we need somebody to develop that .\nUm other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna  instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that\nYeah .\n'cause I have to do an average .\nRight .\nAnd then um excess buttons .\nJust putting no excess buttons .\nExactly . Wow we're doing really well . Yeah , be you know ,\nAs for\nso it doesn't ruin the polarity .\nsee if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nI mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market .\nOr L_C_D_ . Yeah . Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these  um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here  if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those .\nI think we're good .\nOkay . Mm .\nOkay .

And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .\nHand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . Okay .\nWell , just kinetic then ,  .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm what's a hand dynamo ?\nThat was the crank , wind-up crank on the side .\nIt's the wind-up .\nOh\nshoot , forget that . Kinetic is um  and how many of those will we need per  we only need one .\nJust one .\nOkay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .\nUh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple  Just checking that . Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest .\nOkay , and we only need one of those .\nYep .\nOkay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it  single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . It's\nYeah , that that one is single curve ,\nthat's uh uh one .\nisn't it ? Um do we have\nAnd that's\nWhat does double curved mean , I don't understand .\nI I think you  it means you reverse the curve .\nuh that's the the one that goes like this .\nYeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them ,\nOh no , we don't need that . No .\nRight .\nyou can do a banana in single curve ,\nNo ,\nSingle-curved , I'd say .\nsingle curve .\nyeah .\nOkay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour .\nI\nI just wanna say plastic .\nWe had the special colour . And did we say plastic ?\nYeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may\nYeah .\nI mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself ,\nOne , two , three , four , five , six .\nbut it depends on the cost , I guess .\nOkay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . Interface button  push button interface . That's what we're using ,\nIt's just button .\nYes .\nYeah .\nisn't it ?\nYep .\nYeah .\nDo we need to say how many buttons , or\nWhoops , don't want that , not yet . Um\nor d is it just one ?\nNo , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black .\n'Kay .\nAnd the buttons  Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?\nUh they'll be rubber , yep .\nSo we need one of them . And are they any special form ?\nWell yeah , like the compass point one .\nActually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic .\n'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top .\nYeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons ,\nOh .\nbecause we haven't got a double curved case .\nYeah , they could be plastic .\nOkay . Um let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement .\nIt's just one , isn't it ?\nUh we only need one of them . Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .\nWhat , we're in .\nYeah .\nWe're in .  That's us .\nMore profit .\nGreat .\nOkay , I'm going to save this into our  desktop , project documents . Okay . As our project document bit .\nDo you do you need to double click on that to open it ?\nYeah . There we are . That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide .\nYes .\nRight . Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . Yeah , leadership , teamwork ,\nYeah .\nSure . Yes .\nmeans , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things .\nAnd Play-Doh .\nUh-huh .\nYeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought .\nYeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want .\nYep .\nOkay .  So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above .\nYep .\nUm did we find any new ideas ?\nI think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I  that really opened my eyes .\nYeah .  Spongy .\nI I only speak for myself though .\nAnd I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before ,\nYeah .\nso . Good work as a design team ,\nYeah , I think we're a good team actually .\nbecause we\nI'm not sure all the wires are really great though .\nSo we actually worked well as a group .\nI thought so .\nRight . Are the costs within the budget ? Yes .\nOh yes .\nYes .\nIs the project evaluated ?\nYes .\nYes .\nYes .\nYes .\nI can give you a number ,\nhang on , Oh we haven't heard .\nUh-huh .\num it's uh  the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine  we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place .\nYeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology ,\nTo maintain old technology , exactly .\nMm-hmm .\nwhich if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works ,\nYeah , yeah .\nAbsolutely , and it's kept us within budget .\nso . Yeah .\nYes .\nMm-hmm .\nSo we do count as I think excellent or one .\nAlright .\n.\nAnd we've therefore  we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done .\nOkay .\nWe done good , and we're finished in time .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "dynamo, electronic, kinetic, battery, energy", "dialogue_id": 6}, {"text": "Bring on the ice sculptures .\nNice .\nAnd then we get the product launch party .\nSo we might have to wait .\nProduct launch party ?\nYeah .\nThat's what I said , ice sculptures .\nYeah .\nAbsolutely .\nUm I  one thing I want to do is  oh , I think the meeting's done .\nI believe that is the end of our meeting .

Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . Okay um the agenda  we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . We'll look at the finances and finally a  do a production evaluation and close . So , starting off with the um last  the last one , oh I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . Okay ? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first .\nRight , do you wanna start ?\nRight , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one . Um we have our colours not  are not fixed , but this is the general shape . Um it's  you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even  I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push  if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if  uh the volume buttons rather . If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . That's our number one prototype . Um do you wanna present the potato ,\nlike a little lightning in it .\nor shall I present the Martian ?\nOkay ,\nThe little lightning bolt in it , very cute .\num  What  We call that one the rhombus ,\nI could\nThe v the rhombus rhombus ?\nuh the rhombus .\nThat's the rhombus , yep .\nUm this one is known as the potato , uh it's\nit's a\nhow can I present it ? It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . Um it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that's basically it , that's the potato .\nUm on , off ?\nUh that would be one of your channels , basically ,\nOkay .\nso like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off ,\nYeah we turn it off .\nyeah .\nCould the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ?\nUm not really ,\nit would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off .\nMm-hmm .\nIf you pressed and held it maybe .\nYeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . That'd work , yeah .\nIf you like held it down , that would be on off .\nYeah . On off , that's a possibility , yeah .\nOkay .\nAnd then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top .  We have the five preset seeds  .\nAnd then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . So , that's for your consideration as well , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up .\nLet's pass .\nWe figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat .\nUh-huh .\nSorry , what's the yellow one in the middle ,\nUh the menu select button .\nI forgot .\nVery interesting .  I think that one's my favourite .\nSo that's  So that's our three prototypes . Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever .\nMm-hmm .\nWe were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down ,\nMm 'kay .\nmaybe with with less contrasts on it . Yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but\nWould  Yeah , but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy  .\nyeah .\nNow that was one thing that we brought up over email . I don't know if you picked up your email , but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost .\nYeah .\nRight . Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it  it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen .\nMm-hmm .\nSo we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss\nBut if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it .\nIt's really  Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? Do you think that would be conceptually possible ?\nI think\nI think it would be difficult technologically ,\nMm-hmm .\nbecause if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it ,\nMm .\ns so it's  I'm not quite sure how it would work\nThat's true , mm 'kay .\nYeah .\nand then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ?\nThere might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .\nMm-hmm . Okay , that's a fair evaluation . Getting lost . Um we  so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . Okay 'cause  well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um\nSo d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? Um .\nI feel like this is simil  or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat .\nMm-hmm .\nBut I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on  .\nCould we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ?\nMm yeah ,\nYeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah .\nAh ,\nthat's good , that's good .\nthere we go .\nHere , stick it on .\nPut an extra the button on   .\nSure .\nUm uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ?\nWell do we w  like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for .\nOh okay . Okay .\nThat was\nSo where\nI was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me  I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .\nOkay . Do you need this\nor just write on the white board ?\nNo , I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing ,\nOkay .\nRight .\n'cause I think it would be redundant .\nOkay .\nI dunno .\nIt's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing ,\nOoh .\nyou know ,\nCool .\nkinda push it  .\nHey .\n'Kay .\nMaybe a little smaller than that  .\nNo , I kinda like it .\nThat's hard to miss .\nIt makes look more fruity as well .\nOh it does ,\nit's kind of like\nIt's like a deformed foot , I dunno .\nThere it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem .\nLike\nYeah .\nYeah . It almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers  .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nInteresting .\nI like this one .\nOkay ,\nVariety of colours are nice .\nis that where people are leaning then , the potato ? I like the idea of the\nI think I'm leaning towards the potato .\nI mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .\nMm-hmm . I am worried about like um using a menu . Um in that  like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?\nHmm .\nYeah .\nWell that  on the iPod , for example , you just  every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level .\nBut that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ?\nYeah .\nGood point .\nThis is , it's  the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices .\nOkay .\nYou find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh .\nCould these be used for going to submenus\nYeah . Yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah .\nor\nMaybe  yeah ,\nOkay .\nmaybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something .\nMm-hmm . Okay . Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , mm 'kay .\nOkay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities , the yellowy one is that\nThe potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ?\nPotato .\nI think so .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "designing, design, designs, prototypes, presentation", "dialogue_id": 7}, {"text": "Okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one .\nOkay .\nSo basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to .\nOkay .\nSo what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that .\nOkay .\nSo we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . So we can do this one first . First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . So like in my opinion the   for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . That's just my opinion .\nYeah .\nWhat does  each of you\nI I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two .\nOkay , well give it a number ,\nOkay .\nsorry  .\nI will give it a one .\nUm I dunno if it's it's creative . I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . I dunno if any of them are fancy in  I'd say two , because c unique .\nOkay .\nI'll go for two .\nAnd two , awesome . Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one .\nYeah , one .\nOne ?\nI think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two .\nOkay .\nUm functional . I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , um , I don't know if that's gonna be a later one .\nOkay . Well there's some other ones , I will address that ,\nOkay , then I'm gonna give it a two .\nyeah . Awesome , okay . Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative .\nDid you give a functional  ?\nYeah , she said it was one .\nOkay .\nUm is it technologically innovative ? Mm . Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really\nWell , the kinetic battery .\nIn the battery , that's it .\nI kinetic battery is a big one , so .\nHow many people would notice that , though ?\nMm . But it\nBut they'll notice it after like a year ,\nbut we know it's there .\nthey'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery .\nAnd if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool .\nMm . Just the material .\nI'll give it a three . 'Cause it  we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really\nYeah . I I would say that it's  Yeah , like fancy versus creative it's it's different . But does that equal innovative ? I dunno . I'll give it a three .\nAlright . Everyone else ?\nI'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , I mean it's it's just  it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four .\nThink I'm gonna go with the four as well .\nMm 'kay .\nI really like that kinetic battery though .\nNext , is it easy to use ? Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate ,\nMm 'kay .\nso don't overlap them .\nOkay .\nI think it's really easy to use . I'll give it a two .\nUm I'll give it a one . Pretty hard to mess up .\nI'll say one .\nUh let's say two .\nAlright . Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality\nand  if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I  it's spongy all the way .\nGive it a one .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI wonder if it bounces when you drop it .\nOoh , that you couldn't\nMm-hmm .\nit'd be harder to break ,\nMm .\nharder to lose .\nYeah .\n'Cause there would be less impact maybe ,  .\nMm .\nYeah\nIain , what do you give it ?\nI'd I'd give it a one .\nAlright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables  ?\nUh um  .\nWell , is it gonna be yellow ?\nIt it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ?\nThat's right , yeah , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in\nYeah .\num well\nWe might wanna keep it yellow .\nif we  I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in  and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity .\nYeah , but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something .\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nUm and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ?\nIf we had a yellow  Sure .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nOh , yeah .\nFruity , so fruity .\nSo\nAlright , so I think it it's\nit was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity .\nYeah .\nI think i it's kind of mangoey too .\nOh , mango\nMangoey is better , yeah .\nYeah .\nYes .\nI\nthat that\nI like mangoes  .\nokay , I'm giving it a one  the mango  put me over .\nMm .\nThat's a much more trendy than a potato\nWhat are  what's everyone's numbers ?\none .\nUh two .\nOne .\nAlright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , me too .\nUh one .\nDid you say one , Rose ?\nYes .\nOkay um , also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen .\nIt's gonna be hard .\nYeah .\nYeah , yeah .\nAnd if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but um\nUm um worth the risk , I think .\nI like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two .\nYeah . I'll I'll say two as well . Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first ,\nMm .\n'Kay .\nbut\nYeah I'll I'll say two .\nAlright , awesome . And the ease of learning it . I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , I dunno . It sort of reminds me of the iPod . I just got mine , I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay , so\nMm .\nand I'm not good at learning technology . So I'll give it a two .\nThe menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess .\nI think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are\nOh , good point .\nand that could take a bit of learning at first , but\nMm-hmm .\nonce you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . So I'd I'd give it a four .\nOkay .\nI think I'd give it a four too . It's a pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , but\nYeah .\nMm-hmm . Alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , so\nWe we\nI think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , but\nOkay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still  if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're kind of not gonna find it ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut anywhere else it's gonna stand out .\nYeah .\nUm I'd say I'd give it uh a three , I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally .\nMm I'd give it a four .\nUm I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah .\nSmall too .\nAlright , we also said simplicity ,  how w how well does it address just being simple ?\nSimple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ?\nI think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion ,\nso those are the next two things we're gonna look at . Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing .\nRight .\nUm it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two .\nI'm  give it a three I guess .\nI'll give it a two .\nThree .\nAlright , and fashionable ?\nIt's totally fashionable . I'd give it a one .\nIt's hot , I mean it's a mango , come on .\nMango .\nI mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well .\nI dunno .\nI don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote\nI do like uh the little Martian one .\nor alien or whatever he was .\nYeah , the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing .\nNumber .\nUm two .\nThree .\nOne .\nAnd does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? Just that it would se serve our audience . I don't see why not .\nMm-hmm . I think as long  if we offer in a  in at least three different colour arrangements . Um yeah , that's good .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I'll give it a a two  .\nYeah , I'll say two .\nAlright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ?\nWell um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it .\nShall we uh  Well I think all of them should have an R_R_ .\nAll of them should have R_R_ , yeah .\nAnd so we're gonna do that , so it will address it ,\nMm-hmm .

Um and we're having one per  One , okay .\nYeah .\nUm electronics .\nSingle .\nSimple .\nSimple , simple rather .\nSimple .\nMm 'kay . Um the case .\nUh uh uh double-curved .\nGuess it's double-curved . It is pretty curvy .\nIt's very curvy ,\nYeah .\nso okay .\nYeah I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know . Our case material supplements  oops , we just skipped by them .\nWell don't we need plastic , and\nNo , we we  the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . The supplement is\nProvided , okay .\nThe wood ?\nOh , I guess it was rubber rather than latex .\nI mean the rubber .\nIt was rubber and special colour , right ?\nYeah .\nMm-hmm , okay .\nDo we have more than one special colour ?\nYeah , we're using  we're gonna need at least two special colours .\nUh well\nSpecial colours , isn't it ?\nUm .\nI don't know what the se the basic colour is though .\nPer\nI dunno where it  yeah .\nWell , but we know that we're having at least three colours ,\nSo let's y say three .\nso\nWell , are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , you know , we'll  like we'll have yellow and black . Is that two special colours ?\nYeah , I dunno . That I thi\nOr or is white and black , then two more or\nI thought that would be under yours .\nUh . I guess it's three ,\nWe'll just say three .\nthree three  .\nMm-hmm .\nRight .\nMaybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well ,\nAlright .\nso yeah . Interface , we're doing push buttons . And how many buttons do we have ?\nYeah .\nWe have six .\nWe've got five  .\nSix .\nSix , with the power .\nOh\nOh\nsix .\nno , five .\nAnything else ?\nYeah . No . Oh , we'll  do we wa Are the buttons in special colour , special f I didn't get information on\nOh ,\nOh wait .\nbuttons  oh , so um . So the case material will just have one colour , right ,\nWell ,\nbut then the buttons will be in special colours ?\ndoes it\nYeah .\nbut if we're making multiple varieties of  this is where I'm getting confused .\nWe're saying per unit .\nper unit , okay , okay .\nYeah , per unit .\nOkay , so each unit will only have one colour on their\nAlright , and each button s\nbut the case is  could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI like it like that .\nSo\nYeah , okay .\nSpecial form ? They're all kind of just push button ,\nNo ,\nright ?\nI think they're fine .\nYeah .\nSpecial material ?\nMaterial , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah .\nUh . Oh do  I have to do it per button , do I ?\nNo , I don't think so . I think they're\nOkay .\nif they're all gonna be rubber then it  that's what it matters .\nYeah , 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\n'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nIt's  I mean it's two to make it rubber .\nOkay .\nOh wait , so maybe .\nThirteen point seven .\nOh oh .\nYeah , what can we reduce ?\nOkay , let's have our buttons all be one colour .\nMm , I kind of like the buttons .\nLet's see what that would do . It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway .\nAlright .\nOkay um , are we sure this is double-curved ?\nUh .\nMaybe it's single-curved ,\nWe have no idea .\nwe have no idea .\nI dunno , I didn't get any pictures .  It's single curved .\nIt's single curved .\nWhy not ?\nWell it's not the  yeah . Okay , it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve ,\ncase material is rubber and it's a special colour ,\nYeah .\nbut that's important . Six buttons  we have to have six buttons .\nThat is important . How did it get more expensive , what did you just change ?\nWhat ?\nIt was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen .\nNo , okay , maybe not . I don't know what just happened . Now it's twelve .\nWe\nWhat was our target price again ?\nTwelve point five .\nTwelve point five . Hey hey .\nTwelve point five .

Project process . Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well I guess I led it , um the  how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard .\nOkay .\nWell . I felt very creative .\nI think we've been successful\nI enjoyed making the prototypes .\nin that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set\nYeah .\nand we've come up with a finished project and we just about got  cost .\nI think we could've done even better with a little bit more information ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike what's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count\nMm-hmm .\nthings , but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well . Um I think we worked together pretty well .\nYeah .\nYeah , I mean  if I'd had more market research on the  fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah  .\nBut the fruits and vegetables , they really  my creativity , so .\nI know , I really did , the the whole mango idea was great .\nDo you think we could\nNo , I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno . That was a bit of a distraction .\nYeah .\nThat was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to , so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing .\nMm-hmm . I think we all made um very significant contributions ,\nYeah .\nI don't think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good , like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over , um\nYeah .\nI like our little finished products .\nCan we market this as the mango remote ?\nThey're funny .\nReally cute .\nI kind of want one .\nShould we have that somewhere on the packaging ? I have a little R_R_ .\nI'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there  .\nI know ,\nlet's think of it like a little jingle .\nUm .\nI like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in .\nYes . Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget . All thanks to Iain for the design of that one .\n. Okay um\nMm . What did we find for new ideas ?\nnew ideas found ?\nPeople should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables .\nDefinitely . Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm\nYeah .\netcetera .\nI I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them .\nOh , I'm so excited .\nThat was\nYeah , I didn't even know they existed .\nI I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist .\nMm-hmm .\nBut in other things , I think it'd be really good .\nI thi yeah , that's awesome . Um okay , closing . Are the costs within the budget ? Is the project evaluated ?\nYes .\nNow there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . Um so , this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three\nYeah .\nwhich we hope um  yeah . Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and   .\nYeah , Real Reaction .\nI do like the Martian remote .\nIf we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice .\nOh , that would definitely be my second choice .\nAlthough the tog toggle\nMm .\nI'm afraid I would\nThat's cool . Let's all let's all go for the yellow\nI would break it .  I would break it .\nIt's cool . I think I would break it .\nIt started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem\nBreak the stem off .\nand then   alright , so\nOh that's funny  .\nIs  it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian\nOh\nwhen I put the\nKind of looks like a penguin , like  with no eye  .\nTake me to your leader .\nyeah , it's kind of a penguin .\nI like that it stands up .\nMm-mm .\nWow , maybe I should market it to some remote control company now .\nSo are are\nThat was bound to happen.$\nOh , sad .\npoor little thing .\nMm 'kay , congratulations . Um . Anything else to say ?\nNothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over ,\nAlright .\nits all timed .\nUm anybody have\nOh .\nOh .\nI got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master's class ?\nIt's really funny that you got spam in your work emails .\nYeah , but check it out . So like there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere .\nBut all that you need to keep in mind your  knowledge management . Um just wanna make sure you do .\nNo the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us ?\nOh\nIt's very it's very work relevant ,\nIt is .\n'cause people send spam a lot .\nYes definitely\nLet's see ,\nI'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website .  .\nOh here you can you can view .\nwhat did I get through the corporate website ? It's just inspiration about circuit boards .\nYou can just see what's up .\nWow .\nYeah it's it's really deep . Hold on . Takes a little while to get excited to load . That  the Excel thing is pretty cool .\nYes .\nYeah , that is pretty neat .\nI love Excel ,\nHere , like , basically\nit's one of my favourite programs .\nit's like inspiration , basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing , see . You didn't miss out that much .\nI see , mm .\nYeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards .\nSpongy .\nI learned a lot actually .\nMm .\nI could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to .\nOh wow . This one was cooler . I got a whole table and everything .\nNow I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and  I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this  you just need to talk about the case .\nThat's like mine it was like , would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? And then it didn't have like any kind of table , like awesome , I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result  .\nI I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing .\nIt's really interesting though . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWe had a lot of the um  otherwise the technology  today was kinda cool .\nI think . Yeah .\nThat was really neat how I got emails\nMm-hmm .\nand\nWe didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much .\nNo .\nNo .\nAlthough I don't see how we could have very l at least for me\nI  yeah . If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up ,\nMm .\nbut\n'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period .\nYeah , we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut with only four people it doesn't really make sense .\nBut I thought we were good orally .\nAnd with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint\nI think if you had a larger group\nGet crazy .\nYeah .\nas that's not as necessary to have .\nYeah .\nAnd these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here ,\nMm .\n'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room .\nMm-hmm .\nBecause we're all gonna be working in different places .\nYeah .\nWe  if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess .\nNow when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?\nUh we we worked together ,\nYeah .\num but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\num and how we could like improve on the on the design .\nSo it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape\nMm-hmm .\nand he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really .\nCool .\nIt was fun .   So well done with the management , I felt well managed .\nOh thanks .\nI think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time ,\nIt's kinda fun .\nand second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings .\nMm .\nAnd I\nSorry .\nThat happened to me all the time though .\nI know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided .\nMm-hmm .\nBut I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points  at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there .\nYeah , I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting  we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut we were able to do it regardless , so . I'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes .\nThis is what we'll do .\nYeah .\nI found that we did  we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings .\nEspecially last time ,\nYeah , for some of the meetings , yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nyeah .\nYeah I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough ,\nYeah ,\nyou know what I mean ,\nYeah .\nlike we we couldn't answer every single question .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm but\nRight . And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information ,\nMm .\nand not sort of made me really like , ooh I don't know  , throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . I had so much information and so much to talk about .\nIt was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the  when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um , that more points came out from your presentation even .\nYeah . Mm .\nUm . I'm a little  I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a  um something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point .\nYeah .  that was something like  in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and  things like\nAbout  yeah .\nYeah .\nWell the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file , there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nso there was no  we could be like yeah , it has it included .\nI think we were\nMm-hmm .\nThere was no way for us to have\nConsidered the re\nYeah .\nwritten down that it was really there .\nyeah .\nI think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task  .\nWell\nit's interesting that they\nI think we really got into it , I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , I dunno if that's just me ,\nMm-hmm , yeah  .\nbut\nIt was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um  we weren't provided with information to discuss that .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology\nYeah .\nYeah .\nthat  I just don't know what it is , but\nI think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them .\nMm .\nI dunno . I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever\nHmm .\n'cause there's only one T_V_ and there's only like three chairs .\nThat's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and I always do , anyway . You'll lose 'em in your pocket ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike you just will forget that  or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember ,\nMm .\nthere's always ways to lose things .\nYeah .\nIt d yeah , it depends on how organised you are personally , but\nYeah , or like I guess what the setup of the house is too .\nMm-hmm .\nBut , I mean  I am notorious for losing my keys ,\nI just  I guess I've just never lost the remote . I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night  and couldn't find them .\n'Cause I was putting groceries away .\nThat's funny .\nOh .\nYou you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room .\nCan't get in .\nCan't get in , look all around the kitchen . Definitely in the vegetable drawer .\nThat's funny .\nSo  .\nI always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat .\nMm .\nYep .\nBut I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much .\nYeah . Can't really take it into the other room .\nYeah . Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a  robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located\nOh a G_P_S_ system ,  internal G_P_S_ .\nOh man . Here you go .\nWe should make one that walks by itself .\nAlthough if it's sitting still for too long .  Yes I\nThat really could get up and walk away  .\nOr or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there .\nOr little    Or just just a wheel , you know .\nJust if you   like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll  .\nYeah .\nWell , but if you could attach them to the T_V_ , then you can  .\nzoom  Yeah . Hmm . All kinds of possibilities .\nMm . Okay . Sorry , I'm just um trying to update my minutes . I decided to  you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them .\nYeah .\nJust gonna make  I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that .\nOh .\n'Cause that seems a little more useful .\nWow . 'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do .\nBut I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so\nYeah , I guess  How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting .\nMost of it , mm-hmm . I added slides , um I added a couple slides each time ,\nOh .\nbut that was about it .\nOkay . Yeah , I didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them\nMm .\nand fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more .\nWell , the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point .\nAh yeah. .\nI know personally when I do PowerPoint , that's what I do and so  I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three .\nRight .\nYou have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like\nThe slogan on it ?\nNo , no , definitely not .\nNo no no .\nOkay good .\nWe\n'Cause I was like , it could go around the outside .\nNo , I don't think we need to\nI think we just need the um the R_R_ ,\nI think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one .\nyeah .\nIs it yellow and blue ?\nOr yellow and blue . Lemme go to the web page .\nYeah , I was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or  .\nOh I guess it is black , grey . Grey is better than black , doesn't look so bumblebeeish .\nI don't really like yellow in general .\nHey now I understand the random like newsclippings .\nBut it\nFinish meeting now .\nWasn't it interesting that um  I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um\nYes .\nthe marketing choices ,\nyou know , like\nI will\nthat was a bit of a conflict .\nI just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source ,\nit's kind of an  they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence  like we did a survey , this is what people said .\nYeah .\nS mm , I dunno .\nPeople are stupid .\nI guess it i it sort of a grey , isn't it ? Yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue .\nWell we got some grey and we got some blue buttons , we're good .\nYeah . Well we don't have the right colour clay anyway .\nMaybe , like  I don't know .

It won't  doesn't  Maybe we should start with the the technical functions .\nOkay ,\nYeah ?\nhow can I get this on the whiteboard ?\nWell it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder .\nIn project .\nOkay , I've done that .\nYou've already done that ?\nNo can that open .\nYes .\nWell let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one .\nOpen it there .\nUh , well . Yes . Uh-oh . New thing . Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .  About the get\nAnd I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too .\n'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design . Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh  a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um , Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um  Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's  it is uh  can be made as fast as printing paper . It's uh   it's all very uh\nOkay .\nYeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh ,\nOkay .\nand it's not uh very specialised uh technology .  I haven't come to here , but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . So I don't know uh why I should put it here . Uh\nOkay . But it's the technical side of the remote control .\nYes , but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time .\nOh . Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then .\nWhat ?\nOkay .\nBut you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? It's gonna be easy ?\nNo . Yes .\nOkay .\nBut nothing restricted for user interface ?\nYeah . M\nWith technical\nUm , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah .\nI don't know .\nOkay .\n'Kay .\nRemote control is nothing special nowadays .\nR regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter .\nOkay .\nUm\nBut I kind of uh\nI don't think so ,\nOkay . Yeah ,  okay .\nbecause of the  all the televisions uh  there are a few  maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions ,\nYes . Uh\nOkay .\nbut is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ?\nWell , we'll see . We'll see later on .\nWell , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got ,\nNo .\nbut uh I got these two ,\nNo .\nand I think they're  we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user .  th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , I don't s uh know who's doing t\nWell , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ?  The ones I  I've uh received from the account manager .\nYeah , but it  I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control .\nYeah . Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .\nYeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh  yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it .\nUh-huh . Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote .  we should we should choose one uh  we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v\nYes , I agree . Yeah .\nYeah ? Well , what  that's what you want  trying to say .\nWell , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and  we have to choose for novice user .\nOkay . Okay .\nBut I don't know . It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use .\nYeah , well  some of these  Uh , yeah . Well , some of that will  Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements .\nYeah , probably , yeah .\nYes .\nSo\nUh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd from that on we can  user requirements what we need more . Uh  Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy  the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um  uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that .\nYes .\nM you can just  you can k\nI haven't really found a conclusion like that .\nyou can keep it in mind that .\nYeah .\nI don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the  with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh\nDesign .\nyeah , more trendier design , I think . I think .\nSounds interesting .\nYeah ?\nUh , well , that's all I have to say , I think .\nOkay .\nYeah , that was it .\nAlright .\nWell , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market .\nYes .\n.\nYeah . It's alright . Um  Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um  yes . The working method um  there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um ,  three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results .  Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um ,  relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got  we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um  an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . So ,  what I was thinking  oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh  there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh  yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there .\nOkay .\nAnd um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh   Yeah . Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say\nVisually presents .\nYes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh  consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . That was kind of what I found .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nWell , then we  I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important .\nYes .\nUh , well some of the uh new requirements  make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think .\nBecause um uh s decided to put  They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . Well , now I see four .\nTwo ?\nThat's kinda strange . Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off .\nWell\nIt's impossible , I think .\nNo way .\nNo uh , I agree , I agree .\nSo the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special  put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or\nNot too much , no .\nYou know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much .\nYeah .\nSo we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nI don't know . I think that uh that's what they're trying to say .\nUh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested .\nMm-hmm .\nBut , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger\nI don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market .\nYeah , but it is  it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that .\nMayb yeah ?\nOur company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want ,  you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's what the problem is . We haven't got remote controls for uh\nOkay .\nWell I think , yeah .\nMaybe maybe we can compromise a little bit .\nYeah , I think so . Maybe if it's\nNot too much then , bu alright .\nno no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either .\nYes .\nUh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay ,  something else nice to know .\nBut what's our slogan ?\nSorry ? Yeah ,  you will have to look that up .\nThe slogan uh\nYeah , I'll have a look .\nI think it's something about the\nPuts fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics .\nOh , okay .  I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but\nSense simplicity .\nSense and simplicity .\nOkay well ,  let's go back to the the agenda . So we've now had to  the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements . That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the  maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some\nYeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that\nYeah .\nWell , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh  yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control .\nYeah . Yeah .\nI think we can implement more functions then , because um  basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology\nYeah , but wha\nYeah , yeah .\nand therefore will be a more\nM yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other ,\nBut\nbecause they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger\nYes .\nWell , ma\nYeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used .\nYeah .\nSo why should j we put this function in ?\nWell , I think\nI think more  I think uh people  younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions .\nBut I think uh you  we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have  Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player .\nYes .\nYou can uh , know , you  you can  make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was  that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh\nYeah , control .\nYeah , but uh you said\ncontrol , remotely .\nYeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making .\nNo , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the  The new project requirements told us not to\nIt's n Yeah .\nBut maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should\nYeah .\nYeah , well we should uh put some functions for other  maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind ,\nor n what d what do you guys think ?\nBut you can put them under the same button .\nNot much more than that .\nYeah , if  as far as possible .\nYep . Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .\nBut what do you think ?\nSo t\nDo th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that  to control other devices ?\nNo .\nNo , you don't think so ?\nNo , new requirements say no .\nYeah , the new requirements say so .\nSo\nBut you can put a play and stop and and rewind .\nWell , maybe it's\nYeah .\nmaybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control .\nYeah , but\nYou know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with\nYes , but we\nI i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th  with lot more functions .\nY yes .\nYep , exactly . That's that's wha\nBut but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever ,\nNo no , you don't   No no , you don't need it . No , no .\nNo , no . Exactly .\nHuh .\njust play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward .\nOkay , but we have to think uh  w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess ,\nYeah , I know , but uh\nso um but uh from my experience it's kinda  a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . It's c sometimes a bit difficult .\nMm , yeah .\nMaybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh  Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then .\nYes .\nYeah , but just   keep it simple and look more at th\nAnd uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote .\nNo . It's only for television . So\nOkay . It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table ,\nYes , but there are there are\nand it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , nothing more . Exactly .\nOkay .\nAlright .\nUm , but what televis\nBut how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh  dozens of of remote controls that have\nYeah , we we'll make w this one trendy .\nYeah .\nAnd simple .\nThe user interface is easy .\nWell , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels .\nAnd the basic  yeah , basic functions , yeah .\nYes , definitely , yeah .\nUh ,\nIt's too much integrated in the other .\nOkay , a t a teletext button should be there . But just one big teletext button , on and off .\nYeah .\nProbably .\nYeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not  nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader ,\nOh , okay .\nthen I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but\nYeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .\nWell , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it  quite often .\nYeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And\nWill you look\nwe have to  well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated .\nLook at the market .\nWe just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . Yeah . I don't know . I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote .\nWell\nI don't know what you th guys think .\nMight be . Might be .\nYeah , I  uh , it's    Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh\nYeah , but do you like to have a  such a s stop button ? Or do you think it uh  I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function .\nWell , uh when you uh uh  when you look uh  for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the  for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th\nYeah . Okay , it goes  Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . That's why  it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements .\nYes , but you could put\nYeah , but\non the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages .\nWell yeah uh ,\nIf you have seven pages , you can go up and down .\nlots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using\nYes .\nI think we should just put one teletext button on it .\nTrue .\nThen we meet uh the new requirements . we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess .\nA simple  yeah .\nOkay . Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? Or do we  uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . We have the zap and uh the volume . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d\nYes .\nI think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present ,\nTh that's that's that's considered to be trendy also .\nBut trendy , yeah .\nyep .\nOr maybe you should place them on a  uh , in a special way ?\nI don't know .\nMaybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick .\nYeah , something or uh  somethin special way to to zap through the  it has to  s it has to be   yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly .\nOriginal . It was uh\nYep .\nTrue .\nIf you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus .\nYeah , and it  the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid  at a rapid pace .\nYes .\nOh , what should we decide on then ? I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then .\nBut\nYeah .\nNo , it's o just signals uh  and the television d uh does the rest .\nYep .\nMaybe uh\nNo , okay , but we don't have to  uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple .\nNo .\nUh maybe we  uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries .\nI think\nThe most standard batteries .\nI think that we should use uh d\nYeah ?\nI think double A_ .\nyeah , not not uh the b the watch kind\nYep .\nth the most uh  Well , it has to be simple , and I wi\nYeah .\nThe most ordinary uh batteries .\nWhich are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know .\nOkay .\nYep .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "file, remote, technical, presentations, document", "dialogue_id": 8}, {"text": "Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? M m m more than thirty minutes ?\nI think about twenty minutes .\nUh ten twenty minutes .  Well , uh these these shouldn't\nEarly break .\nBut i in a way we have to be uh uh special .\nYeah . Yeah , okay . But that's that's  Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can  what the extra touch can be . Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or\nMaybe th m\nWell , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing .\nI think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh  ten to twelve or whatever .\nTo find him . That's maybe  yeah .\nYeah .  I don't know . I don't know .\nNah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i  has something nice .\nYeah , yeah , that's good one , yep .\nOr maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it ,\nYeah .\nor maybe it should   or an  or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special .\nYeah .\nIt's gonna cost twenty five Euros .\nYe I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination .\nYeah , but the  well , it's already been done .\nYeah , but that's  yeah .\nNah .  Yeah , that's true . But  and I think it's gonna be uh very uh  it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something .\nYes .\nit has to be used something special ,\nYeah .\nand you really   it has to ,\nYep .\nyou know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know .\nNo , that's true .\nSo maybe uh that's i I think that's  when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it .\nBe original , yeah .\nUh , also for you maybe , when t you  it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend  use friendly as well , you know .\nMm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah .\nSo big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUh-huh .\nMust brain-storm .\nYeah , a swapable front or whatever .\nYeah , or just different colours would be uh  I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control .\nWell\nFor the remote control .\nIt could be be  Yeah , you never know , but\nWhy not ?\nYeah .\nMore money for us .\nBut it  and I think we have to make it quite big .\nYeah . Quite big . Yeah , you think ?\nYeah ,\nYes , definitely , definitely .\npeople\nThat's to be uh a formed for your hand .\nSo , and and also because uh it is expensive . If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions\nwant to be  you don't want to get it l make it\nYes , it  it it should be f  be visible nearly anywhere in the room . As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o\nMm-hmm . And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . I I think you m might wanna put it uh\nA standard or something .\nyeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah , you have to put it on its  So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table .\nYeah . A face ?\nno no ,  put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something\nOr uh yeah , yeah . Yeah .\nMore like a joystick then .\nYeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep .\nIt's like you have uh four phones . Something like that .\nYeah yeah , but  yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in\nIf you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros .\nThat it's it's fashionable .\nI  I don't\nI in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise .\nOh , yeah .\nThat's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ?\nBut that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second\nUh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control .\nYeah , but but when you   when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it\nNo uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in .\nOh , okay .\nOn the television .\nUh , that's kind of nice .\nOh , like this .\nIf an  a button in in that uh\nAnd then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable .\nOr you can\nA char  chargeable . Yeah .\nYeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not .\nYeah .\nYeah , that w yeah , but  yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't  Yeah .\nWhy not .\nMaybe you , but  we don't know much about production cost , but when you  you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money  there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know ,  rechargeable units .\nWith recharger .\nIt should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ?\nYeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and   So , it's not gonna be that expen\nProduction .\nYeah , okay .\nUh I I think it's a great idea .\nIt should be possible . I think it's a good idea .\nYeah .\nS some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays .\nTo make a base or something ?\nYes . Yes , definitely . Yeah .\nYes , but is that handy ?\nWell , I  well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one  .\nIt's it's it's it's\nAnd uh you can always find your remote control up\nit's not the purpose to be handy , it's\nBut but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries .\nUh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could  when that's  when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger ,\nAnd then you\nbut you will  you do need uh also an  uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Does it makes it kinda\nYes . Or\nWell y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course .\nMm . Yeah , but that's not  it's ugly , I think .\nYeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah .\nI don't know .\nYeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it .\nNo .\nOn the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . I mean , it looks trendy and still  still put a bleep function in it ,\nYeah .\nbut um I think the bay is definitely uh\nI think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we um  Well , we uh  it's  it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . We can save on the on the functions . We just  put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up ,\nSure , why not . Yep .\nit's also nice . And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to  we uh  that's uh\nYeah .\nit's not a easy market .\nYeah .\nWe have to something special . And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control ,\nYeah .\nTrue .\nand we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions ,\nYeah .\nDefinitely .\nbecause we aren't gonna put\nWith eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely .\nYeah . And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this   and then you also you got the stand-up thing . Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea .\nYeah .\nYeah , it must be must be a gadget to have .\nYeah .\nDefinitely , yeah .\nOh , if it  let's  well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing .\nYeah .\nAnd the first thing we  the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that .\nYeah , we c\nBut it would be nice .\nIt would be nice , yes .\nIt's the idea . I know that batteries last long nowadays . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo   I've experienced that that\nMost televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so  yes .\nYeah , okay . So , easy functions . Well , we will we will  I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi\nOr just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down .\nYeah . But it's also annoying .\nYeah , why not .\n'cause as long as it stays  as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it .\nHmm .\nYeah .  true .\nThen it beeps all the time and  .\nNo , that's true .\nYou don't want to have  ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable  . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . Uh , i i in the in the ma\nWhy not .\nBut you pay for it .\nYeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look  get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of  they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh ,\nYeah .\nI think it's brilliant .\nBleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah .\nYeah , I've never  it's so simple , but I've never seen it .\nYeah .\nM maybe we should really  do this .\nAnd you can leave it just there .\nNo .

And uh opening and uh P_M_s  of the meet minutes , uh prototype presentation from uh Christine and uh Agnes .\nAgnes , yes .\nYes and uh evaluation criteria . The finance , it's uh from my side , from the management , and uh production evaluation . Then uh closing . So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so  Okay , let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype .\nMm , okay .\nSo I handle to\nI've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me .\nSo shall I go to  sorry .\nUh thank you , so you did a PowerPoint presentation , good for you .\nYep . S Okay , let's go to A_M_I_ .\nIt's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but\nSo in two or three or\nThree . Um .  No it's\nProbably . Technical pa I would think .\nthink it's the last one . No , then this is  the la yeah , that one , final design .\nHa .\nYeah .\nIt is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name .\nUm okay , can I have the mouse ?\nYes .\nThanks . Alright , so from  when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off .  Um , so  to unveil our lovely product . This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see .\nSo if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display .  Um , this is actually hard to do . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . So up  volume up , down  volume down . The green are the channel changing .  S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time .\nMm-hmm .\nSo .\nUm and uh I could\nOh yes .\nYeah the d\nAdditional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .\nWe haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um\nYeah .\nI think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the  under the flip .\nYes , okay . Uh-huh .\nSo that will be the safe , so p any  the chip  it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone  to\nNo , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board .\nYes .\nBut it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice .\nUh it's it's  Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised .\nBut if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice .\nMaybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand .\nYeah . And you don't wanna let go of either one .\nI don't wanna say . Louder .  Yeah .\nI mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere .\nCan also be on the side .\nYeah , the sides maybe is good .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo , I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to\nYes . So it's maybe good idea .\nYeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin .\nNo , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been  not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice .\nYeah .\nYes . Yeah  .\nYeah , exactly .\nYeah .\nSo it's maybe good idea . S s\nIt's um  It's um\nCompliments to the artist .\nYou need to work on the weight a little bit .\nYes .\nUh  .\nOkay . S  I'm fine , I'm satisfi\nAnd maybe the shape of the buttons ,\nI'm satisfied .\nthe little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but\nWe're glad you're satisfied .\nOf course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but I think when it's completely  maybe it's a less weight .\nYeah . I mean this is plasticene .\nYes .\nThere's only so much you can do . We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well .  But  And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I mean maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight ,\nYep .\nit needs to feel like you're still holding something .  So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually .\nThat's your uh prototype model ?\nYeah .\nOkay , that's good , thank you very much .\nSo any comments or uh\nWell , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings .\nOkay .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentation, meeting, powerpoint, meet, closing", "dialogue_id": 9}, {"text": "Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh\nYes , that uh  So I'll come back to the   So evaluation criteria , I think uh that will be good , so then let's come to the finance uh , I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget . So here you can uh look like uh the energy  and uh  dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells . Uh it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what uh we were talking about that .\nSo then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then uh we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . So it's uh  actually , our budget was uh twelve point five Euro , but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under uh  below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . I think it's a good figure .\nYes , great I  I'm surprised .\nCongratulations .\nThan thank you .\nWell we haven't come to mine yet , so\nOh , okay\n. It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ?\nwe're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes .\nSo maybe it's  for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing , for the sales , okay , and uh\nWell , it just depends on if we're gonna add a  o on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive ,\nNo we do , but it's not filled in .\nit's gonna be\nIt's not .\nThirty .\nIt's not  it doesn't say .\nIt's number thirty .\nYeah . Yeah .\nWe don't have the price up there ,\nOh , yeah , yeah ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nyou're right , sorry , yes .\nYeah .\nokay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested . Um\nSo that means we can put the uh  the L_C_D_ in , yeah .\nDisplay in . But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see uh  the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that  has to be taken in into consideration .\nUh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh\nYes , so still uh we have twelve point five Euro .\nAnd that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh  the cost of the unit for the company .\nYes .  Yeah , but  Yes . Yep .\nUm-hmm .\nSo to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways .\nYes . This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down .\nYes .\nAlthough customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on  on-order basis , it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh\nSlightly .\nYeah .\nIt's gonna be very hard to reduce .\nYes .\nthe circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would uh  be fixed at the  Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro .\nThat's not bad .\nThat's really  that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding .\nYep . Yeah .   But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down .\nIf we can go to to my display . And we'll come back to yours\nYes .\njust to give everybody an idea of the market . So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project .\nIf I'm still here .\nYou're in four ?\nYep The four gives me  it's gotta be uh TrendWatch .\nTrendWatch .\nIs this the same one you did before ?\nNo .\nOkay .\nIt shouldn't be\nThat's  no , I think it's the same one .\nif it's not  it's not the right one . No , no we g no , that's the same one . You have to go back and find another one . Whatever name it popped up under .\nFunctional .\nUh functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see .\nIt looks like it , there's   S Yeah .\nYep , that's it . So we'll go screen by screen .\nOkay .\nAlthough  since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it  this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study .\nYep .\nSo if we continue , we'll look at the findings . Next screen .  Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhich is actually a tremendous amount .\nYeah , no kidding .\nNo kidding , yeah .\nMayb maybe they already expected something .\nSo , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay ,\nYes .\nwith transport , promotion , labour , because we hav  gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers .\nUm-hmm .\nTwenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit .\nMm-hmm . Yep .\nOkay ? So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the  of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now .\nYes . Yep . Of course .\nSo , now we have to come up with a decision .\nMm .\nCan the company sell two million units ?\nYep .\nCan it sell it for fifty Euros ?\nCould could I go to findings ?\nYep .\nUh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering\nYes .\nI was thinking the same thing , yeah .\nand then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence .\nDirectly .\nThat way you have no storage , you have no um  you do have transportation , still have the labour cost ,\nUm-hmm .\nbut you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale .\nYes .\nThe point of sale is online .\nYeah .\nTo the agents .\nYeah . You can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs .\nRight , like Amazon . In fact , we should sell through Amazon ,\nYes . Or eBay , or\ndon't you think ? Or eBay , yeah .\nYes .\nYeah .\nThere's an idea .\nYeah , that's a good idea .\nGoing with um\nTo impro more profit and uh\nS Upscale technology .\nYeah , yes .\nAh , we we're do you know , selling a unique product uh .\nWell .\nThat actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as ,\nMm .\nThere are several companies that have gone that way .\nwhereas if you're in a store , you can't  unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want ,\nMm .\nwhereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and\nMm-hmm . And you can even have an  a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight .\nYeah . The weight and feel .\nWeight , the feel of the product , but\nMm .\nYeah .\nWe're getting used to that . It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying .\nYeah . Yeah .\nThere are several that have gone through with the watches , too . You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production ,\nUh-huh .\nMm-hmm .\nyou can change it uh  There's a lot of online that's  that is doing this now .\nYes .\nAnd when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way uh  it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could  you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWe can .\nGreat .\nI don't think that's uh not possible , it's uh  okay then , l uh let's wait for the production , okay , then uh you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "budget, costs, financial, million, cost", "dialogue_id": 9}, {"text": "What turnaround time do we have ?\nT\n'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long .\nOh but  Yes it's it's very quick , of course . It will uh come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks .\nWorks for me .\nFor evaluation , okay .\nPrototypes , you mean .\nYes , the prototype uh  prototype product evaluation .\nIn um  We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it .\nYes . Yes . Yes .\nWell , obviously .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea ,\nSo you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks .\nto see  get get their\nMm-hmm . Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use\nYeah .\nit's not a trivial task .\nYeah , because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua\nNo no . We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory .\nYes , yes .\nSo we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time .

Hm ?\nAny outstanding   ?\nS Any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss ?\nNo , I'm\nWhat ab\ngo ahead .\nI think we pretty much covered everything .\nOkay , so then uh\nDid you have something ?\nWell I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently .\nOkay uh , let's take like this . Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay .\nSo no more changes will be made , okay , in this  the basic design . Okay ? So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the\nSecond generation .\nsecond generation .\nOkay . There's no end , there's not limit .\nThe problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of .\nEvery every custom\nWell , then it may not be .\nOkay . Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit .\nLike people don't like wood .\nNo , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up .\nvery specific .\nYeah , so that's the reason you are here for uh the design , okay , I hope you made a good design .\nYes , but I'm not everybody .\nI mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell .\nYeah , but uh see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like uh you can eat uh  you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know ,\nso we have we have to balance somewhere .\nYeah , of course . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short  well you have no redesign  not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and\nYes .\nOur project doesn't  um\nYeah .\nEd , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ?\nHmm .\nWould it be the Christmas season by any chance ?\nThe sports time .\nSports season . Which sport season ?\nRight before the Eur  the World Cup .  World soccer . World Cup soccer ,\nFootball .\nSo  so\nYeah .\nthey need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control .\nFootball .\nmaybe what\nSo I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final  the the launch of a user-tested device with some  special event .\nYes . Yes .\nAnd and then um\nYeah , that's a good idea .\nso that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I don't know when the World Cup is , but I'm sure there's gonna be one .\nOr any major sports .\nOr another  m major sports event . Probably not the um the football games coming up the end of January . I think that might be a little too aggressive um ,\nYes .\nYeah .\nbut , so , I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing\nResearch .\npri and then to launch um at a a major sports event\nMm-hmm .\nYep .\nor uh perhaps to uh also\nThat's actually good place to advertise it too .\nAnd to work with motion pictures .\nYeah .\nThere might be some motion pictures that are coming out um  that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with Sony Pictures for example .\nYes .\nMaybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage .\nMm-hmm .\nYes , the  that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay .\nThat's great .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "prototypes, prototype, evaluation, production, testing", "dialogue_id": 9}, {"text": "It's just something to to keep in mind , 'cause it's really really important .\nSure , sure , yes .\nA lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy .\nDisposable diapers is an example of that in fact .\nReally ?\nYes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years  that was a disposable consumer product ,\nThat I didn't know .\nand uh people  the market hadn't really  gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't uh\nMm-hmm .\nbut then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design ,\n.\nbut people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um  so , you're right , timing is very important ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nbut I think we've got a good product .\nThat's the reason Ed is here .\nYeah .\nI think he can promote the the brand value and the product value .\nThat's right .

Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves ,\nAnd then full screen .\nso the functional requirements are  is  is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide . Cause that's where m my discussion starts . Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_  whatever you want it to do\n'Kay .\num and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do .\nMm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Hmm hmm . Mm .\nSo in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we  anybody can th throw anything in\nYeah .\nand then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nSo that was um what I meant there , and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present . Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase ,\nMm .\nwe want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that . And take out their wallet and buy it . So it's gotta be really attractive and it  but it's gotta go to market by September , 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas .\nYeah .\nUm  and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "slides, slide, stage, requirements, participant", "dialogue_id": 10}, {"text": "Okay .\nand I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view .\nOkay .\nSo I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you ,\nMm mm-hmm .\nand I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know ,\nWhat features .\nwhat what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle ,\nS sellable . Yes  .\n'cause we gotta sell this sizzle  .\nA lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever .\nYes .\nOkay can we go to the next slide please ? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything .\nI'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be   And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp .\nUh okay , can can I at this point interject um something ?\nI have to wind up ? Yeah , sure .\nUm we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . Um the one thing for example  something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext ,\nOkay .\nbecause that's sort of outdated with the internet ,\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nand according to to higher management the  it should only control the T_V_ ,\nmostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things ,\nComplicated , yeah , of course .\nand they are concerned with the time to market .\nYeah .\nOf course , yeah .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nUm and the\nOkay , so that's something\nand the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their  that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at . These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things , so it's only gonna be T_V_ ,\nOkay so\nbut the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea .\nOkay .\nMm 'kay .\nOkay .\nAlright , thanks for that . Um alright now  other things that I found out on  in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the  a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . 'Kay can we go to the next slide please ? Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . Uh because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back .\nIf somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead . They're never gonna come back and buy it . You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros . So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that . Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much . Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "budget, suggest, ideas, suggestions, purchase", "dialogue_id": 10}, {"text": "Yeah .\nOkay that's uh about it for me right now .\nOkay . And uh who would be next , uh , I guess that would be you . Mm-hmm .\nYeah 'kay .\nYou want me to get your slide show up ?\nYeah yeah sure .\nMm-hmm .\nThank you .\nAnd you are number three ?\nNumber two ,\nNumber two .\nyeah . Yeah exactly .\nOkay . Okay .\nUh can you make it uh full screen please ?\nMm-hmm . Yep .\nNo , it's like a well you you have to press here . The cup cup shape here ?\nYeah yeah , uh-huh .\nThe thir third .\nThere , mm-hmm .\nYeah exactly . Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . Um can you go to the next sli slide please ?\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nThe metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th\nMm-hmm .\nthis integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se  send a signal ,\nSignal .\nand the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control\nReceive .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nand uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices .\nMulti-purpose .\nYo and it's\nYeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook  .\nyeah  but it's so  .\nUh yeah .\nYep .\nUm . So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . So uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a  there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions .\nMm okay .\nSo can you go to the next slide please ?\nOkay .\nSo I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also ,\nMm-hmm .\nit's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they  those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's  this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . And there should be a child lock , like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible\nYeah well  yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now . Mm-hmm .\nbut it uh\nWell we already eliminated that .\nyeah yeah yeah\nEliminated .\nso it's it's okay , yeah , yeah . And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands\nand um so that uh\nNow that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun  the fun shape .\nYeah , yeah , yeah and colours also , different colours , and\nYeah I\nMm-hmm colours .\nAnd that  you you say that won't add too much to the budget ?\nNo no no , it won't uh I don't think it will be like ,\nTo d the shape is uh\nyou can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more\nIt just build a mould basically and uh you know .\nYeah yeah .\nYes exactly .\nIt's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter .\nAs the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or\nYeah .\nDo you think there's any chance of um having ser in  having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?\nYeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah .\nOh yes .\nIs that gonna be a possible ?\nYes .\nI think\n'Cause that might help with the marketing .\nI think we will have to look at the budget on that\nYeah that will be\nbut I think in principle that that would be  that would be kind of fun , you know .\nYeah yeah .\nBecause we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nSilly for children .\nYeah , for children , yeah exactly .\nsilly for children\nLike an animal or\nor a little animal shape or in a  or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .\nLike a doll , or\nYeah , that's what , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , exactly . Yeah .\nYes  .\nAnd and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are  which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so .\nMm . Well , I think  I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person\nYes .\nYep , yeah .\nbecause I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my  what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one .\nMm-hmm .\nThe changing modes was something\nYeah , it's like you know  yeah .\nI mean you and I , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time ,\nYeah . Yeah , yeah .\nOkay .\nchanging modes is nothing for us , but people who\nYeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know ,\nN and\nand and it's a small button and and it  they don't press it exactly\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nyou know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else\nYeah , yes .\nand they're very frustrated you know .\nSomething else .\nAnd that's  and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel , and um  you don't feel the mode change .\nYeah , yeah you don't  us yeah yeah , usually . Yeah .\nSo um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too .\nYeah shapes also , different shapes .\nYou know , like the  a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it .\nYeah that will  Mm-hmm .\nChannels .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm , mm-hmm .\nYeah ,\nBut we'll get to that with you .\nYes .\nyeah , and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh\nThat's right , yeah . Now that's a good point . Yeah .\nYes .\nSo yeah .\nAnd uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's\nYeah , that's that's a good  that's a good one ,\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nMm yeah .\nYeah , and we display a clock .\nbecause the clock would be really friendly ,\nYes .\nand and when is your favourite show coming on\nYeah .\nYes .\nYeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so\nYeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh\nYes  .\nand   Yeah , and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute .\nYeah .\nYeah that's that's good , the clock is good .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . Uh can you go to the next slide please ?\nOkay .\nUh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch . And uh bulbs . Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose ,\nHmm .\nthen the remote controller should automatically have a b s light .\nMm-hmm .\nThen it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source , not from  through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light .\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe we can have that . Whenever the T_V_ is on , remote controller will have a light .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd then uh infrared bulbs . Um this is like uh when it is dark .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , mm-hmm .\nAnd battery , there should be a battery for power supply ,\nMm-hmm .\nand a chip ,\nMm-hmm .\nchip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations ,\nMm-hmm .\nand wires connecting all chips , which is uh lights , everything ,\nYeah .\nOkay .\nso there should be wires . And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .\nTo keep the remote ? Yeah .\nYeah .\nCase .\nA case holder . A holder  remote holder .\nYeah , holder .\nHolder , yeah , mm-hmm .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "controllers, controller, controls, slide, remote", "dialogue_id": 10}, {"text": "Um uh can you move onto the next slide .

Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website , uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points .\nMm-hmm .\nThat's it , that's it from me now .\nOkay .\nSo it  um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there ? Or\nUm .\nWell , you don't have to .\nUh it's not like that , I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so .\nOkay . Okay .

No no , I'm three .\nYou're three . Would you want it full full screen ?\nI can make it full ? Yes yes yes .\nMm-hmm ? Okay .\nOkay . As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah can you please go onto the next slide ?\nMm-hmm .\nSo I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . Now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_ .\nMm-hmm .\nThere should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it .\nMm-hmm .\nNow there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice .\nOn the on on the remote . Yeah , mm-hmm .\nYes . Yes . So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm .\nSo he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel .\nYes . By your child , mm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the uh the uh and the  one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nUh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television . And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down , like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nMm , 'kay .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock ,\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nand I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .\nYeah , sure .\nMm-hmm .\nIf there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .\nYes ,\nAnd an alarm clock , yeah that should  that should be okay .\nand as John Reece said the buttons can be , uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently . So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he uh he should not be harmed in any way .\nHmm .\nAnd findings , uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh  So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used  which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . Next slide . And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . Not , uh no uh like it can  it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that . And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .\nIt's like a t okay , it's like a timer  it's like a lock to the television .\nTimer , yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nTimer . Yeah and then you can use a timer as well . Yes .

However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . And uh what function , working design , how how does it work .\nOkay .\nSo these are the two things we should come up wit with . So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group . Um . I guess in many ways everybody . Everybody who has a T_V_ .\nMm , T_V_ , yeah .\nT_V_ television we was .\nYeah , and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_ .\nDon't T_V_ , yeah .\nThere are a few but in general not .  Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups . We have  we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands ,\nMm-hmm .\nso I think that's uh one group that's certainly important .\nHmm .\nUm then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear .\nYeah .\nAnd uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not .\nMm .\nSo this  these are just some thoughts I have on it , and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nor whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm . Well you know there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone .\nMm-hmm .\nSo if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull .\nThat has a lot of  that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups .\nMm .\nI think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours .\nMm-hmm .\nYou know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever  you know\nDifferent colours .\nYeah .\nThat's right .\nYes .\nYou can make a banana shaped one .\nyeah , for example you know .\nYeah . Mm .\nBut the question is really , who is our target group .\nMm-hmm .\nDo we look at one target group ?  And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?\nRespect . Mm .\nOkay . No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty\nRight .\nand and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .\nWith with  Mm-hmm .\nWe can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know .\nWell that's that's\nBut in a family  in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes .\nyeah . Children and everybody , yeah .\nThey would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh\nYeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know .\nWhat about the electronics ? That's not really gonna change much , is it ?\nYeah .\nCost effective .\nNo , it it doesn't cost , yeah .\nNo\nThat  that w that won't change much , will it uh ?\nYeah . Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter .\nThe the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function ,\nI d I wouldn't think so .\nand I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nThe question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . I mean the basic design I understand will be the same ,\nYeah .\nbut the question is how much will that set us back if let's say  uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo that remains to s to be seen but  uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_ .\nThat's right ,\nYes .\nand can we  can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ?\nYeah , well that's that's the question .\nUm the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case .\nHmm hmm .\nAnd in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ?\nUh no . Mm , I I I don't think no . It's not .\nUm you as an industrial person ?\nWell maybe there's  there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ?\nMm-hmm .\nThey have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever ,\nYeah . Mm-hmm .\nand maybe something like that ,\nOkay .\nthat in each package you know you have  you you have  you have for example uh  you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package .\nWell there's a real idea yeah . Mm-hmm .\nHmm .\nAnd then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .\nYeah .\nYou know ,\nYeah , like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .\nRight .\nUm\nyes .\nMm-hmm .\nThat's right ,\nYes .\nand  but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package ,\nUh yeah .\nthen they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy\nYeah .\nAn alternate package .\nan alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know .\nYeah . Okay .\nBut uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we  if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people .\nWell I think  I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote\nYeah , but uh\nWell I think we can only aff  , yeah .\nOkay .\nand what the only change is gonna be um\nYeah .\nthe funct d t yeah uh\nCosmetic .\nOf th okay .\nthe functional  functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way ,\nOkay .\num having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um\nMm-hmm .\nFive minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message .\nWarning , finish meeting now .\nFinish meeting now . Um um .\nWell we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um\nYeah , maybe , yeah , yeah .\nBut I think\nIf we do some more research , maybe we  .\nI I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .\nOkay ,\nMm-hmm .\nmm-hmm .\nHmm yeah ,\nDo we agree , do we ?\nI think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like  yeah .\nOkay but we have to l\nDo we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .\nYeah , yeah , of course , yeah .\nYes .\nOkay , fair enough .\nOkay ? So now I understand it's lunch break .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd um . So that's what we will do .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nSo hank you very much .\nThank you .\nAnd we'll see you after lunch .", "topic_id": 4, "keywords": "groups, group, agenda, meeting, people", "dialogue_id": 10}, {"text": "Okay .

Okay , so  Right well um from the last meeting  I was trying to send you the minutes , but uh it didn't work out too well , so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had .\nUh right , so  Wishing I hadn't closed the damn  Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time . We're gonna have uh effectively two pages , a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements . And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . So . So basically what decisions uh have we uh made ? Uh have there been any uh changes ?\nI think we all have a presentation again ,\nRight .\nso if we go through those and then um\nYeah .\nThree presentation , yeah .\n. Shall I go first again ?\nSo  Yeah , fine .\nOkay .\nI see  this a little more smoothly than the last one .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "design, conceptual, presentation, meeting, decisions", "dialogue_id": 11}, {"text": "Okay right , let's get started . Um basically the uh for the  Um I'll  back actually . For the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . Then there is a chip and still the sender . So um yes  including the power s supply as well . Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , um .  There's a dynamo . Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up  um . There's a kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . Um that's one option ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut I think that was gonna cost a little more . And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option . For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , which is  Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction . So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options .\nOkay .\nUm so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal  for like uh like modern computer . Um there's a scroll wheel which is  you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume .\nMm-hmm .\nYou could do do that .\nMm-hmm .\nUm one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . Um moving on to the printed s\nWhat would be the cost do do we know ?\nUm that's on the next\nI th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . Um which is the next section . Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just  see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote .\nMm-hmm .\nThe firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . And there's different prices according to each . So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button .\nMm-hmm .\nUm one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . And that's it .\n'Kay .\nwith the printed circuit boards you were going for the\nThanks .\nUm i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing .\nMm-hmm .\nUh but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into .\nBut are we going f R right .\nUm that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um .\nSo are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue ,\nYeah yeah . We decide . Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nso would it not be best to  rather than  I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . The other way would be to do the presentation\nMm-hmm .\nand then make the decision at that point in time .\nUm . Maybe w\nYeah , that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away .\n'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular  and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time\nUm .\nand then that would be the end of that issue . Does that make sense ?\nYes .\nUm I have a lot of the information there .\nMm-hmm .\nIt might not be very clear .\nIs there\nUnless you want to plug it back in to yours .\nUm . We could do , yeah . Um yeah we should  .\nAs I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel ,\nMm-hmm .\nit didn't  The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um .\nNo the scroll wheel required the regular , so the\nYeah if if you  down um . It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted ,\nHmm .\nbut the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip ,\nwhich is in the higher price range .\nOkay . The display requires an advanced chip\nI think the scroll wheel um\nthe display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .\nAlso the display's for something else which we decided against . Um but that bit\nOkay .\nAnd note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down .\nDown .\nYeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ?\nMm-hmm .\nI I've got um pictures well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it ,\nRight . Okay .\nand they don't really look great .\n'Kay . So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the\nSo . So we're going for p Okay . So  is um\nSo are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ?\nYeah , a simple pushbuttons .\nSimple push button .\nOkay .\nDid everyone get this on the speech recognition ? The um it was basically what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message um and replies to you .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nSo it is basically the concept we discussed before . Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board .\nI'm guessing it would , but  got like the definite information . Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than\nSo if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? Or are we going for the regular ?\nUm if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board .\nMm-mm . But is there any other   I mean okay , that's true for the  for for that element , but we have to take all  el elements into consideration . And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . S\nMm .\nHmm . But\nI suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we  m make a decision .\nRight .\nBut the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just  it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message .\nMm-hmm .\nOh yeah , I suppose so , yeah .\nSo maybe that would be something separate , yeah .\nSo I don't think it would effect our circuit board .\nNo .\nYeah .\nOkay , so we'd have a simple circuit board\nand that would be an extra that would be in addition to it .\nYeah .\nOh that makes sense .\nAnd I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it .\nYeah .\n'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo .\nMm-mm .\nIt might be useful to say like where are you remote . Here I am , Jo .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nBut I think that's maybe as far as that one could go ?\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility .\nYeah , just as a fun way to find it .\nOkay . Um .\nSimple circuit board . Simple push button . Okay . W w kinetic .\nAnd it says that\nYou were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .\nI think it said the cost of that isn't too much .\nUm yeah I I thought so just for  just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nUm .\nAnd how does it get uh charged up ?\nIt's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nSo you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nSo the speech recognition was  Are we going for speech recognition ? No ? 'Cause that required the advanced\nUm I think it would be helpful to find it , but I don't think it'd um\nJust\nUh yeah I think  did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected\nYeah , I think so .\nJust just for the call and find thing .\nIt was just\nI had speech recognition requires advanced req require\nOh no th that's what that's what I thought , but maybe maybe it doesn't  .\nOh .\nUm I think I might have got that wrong .\nSo okay .\n'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it ,\nSpeech recognition you reckon then is s simple .\nit's not part of the\nIt's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah .\nAnd so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . Would that be\n'Kay .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\n'Kay shall I pass on to you now ?\nI think\nIn fact , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ?\nI'll just just check what it said . Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , so like it's already kind of\nYeah .\nI assume it would cost extra , but  Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .\nAnd then have to change all  change  everything at the last minute .\nOkay . S\nUm .  Oh , that was quick . Um okay , so very brief presentation , um . From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . All of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons . Does that move it ?\nSorry ?\nIt just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything .\nYeah , I've found that  try and get it back .\nIf you right click and then go onto a previous slide .\nAh it's alright .\nOkay , right .\nUm . There wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling .  Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . And uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . Um so that's a bit of competition there . So I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control\nYeah , yeah .\nrather than trying to compete with the functions . Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . And there's no real advantage and  because it impacts on other  on the materials and the price it's not great .\nOn the price , yeah .\nSo you were saying the scroll buttons\nUm  Yeah . Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . There was children's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels .\nMm-hmm .\n'Kay .\nUm but I don't know if that's really in our field ?\nI guess I guess we're going for the biggest market ,  maybe not ,\nBut that's something that's out there .\nbut  Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ?\nWell we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude\nHmm .\nThe one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a  You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . But that's really where your field is .\nMm-hmm .\nSo maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should\nAnyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .\nHmm .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nOkay .\nIs that\nRight well that's something that we can be aware of .\nSo so what are we deciding to do here ?\nUm . I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function .\nRight . Mm-hmm . Uh the fi Yeah , the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSo you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . S s so um\nOh yeah . Different languages might not be compatible .\nYeah , yeah . It w it would make it quite complicated ,\nHmm .\nwhere um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the\nHmm .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , 'cause I think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah and ours is quite a cheap device , so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it .\nYeah .\nSo you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nAnd you were talking\nMaybe unless something else comes up .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remotes, batteries, buttons, battery, remote", "dialogue_id": 11}, {"text": "Mm . And you were talking about scroll buttons ?\nUm yeah I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost\nOkay .\nand give no real kinda extra benefit\nb\nYeah .\nand it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .\nAlright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , was that right ?\nYes yes .\nHmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote .\nOkay . So not to be focused on .\nYeah . Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . Um just to avoid ambiguity . So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume ,  Um let's think how they did this .\nGood in in  Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down .\nI'm just gonna check so I do this right .\nAn upside-down V_ . So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .\nUm . What did they say ? Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see\nRight .\nActually that can't be right , can it ? Oh well , no , they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up .\nMm-hmm .\nSo , be careful what you put on the buttons\nSo maybe we could have like\nand be careful of the shape that you make them ,\nYeah .\nbecause they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah I I know what you mean . So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYou could have volume up and volume\nPossible .\nVolume up , down and  Like that .\nMm .\nAnd 'cause the idea was to have limited um  it was to have sizable amount of information on it . Limited number of buttons .\nYeah yeah  .\n'Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were\nYeah . Yeah we got it down to not too many .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and I think that's all I had to say for that .\nOkay .\nUm so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button ?\nUm  Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t\nI've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .\nOkay .\nYeah , maybe we should see yours first .\nOh okay .\nCool . Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one  that's the one I talked about last time , that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends .\nYou know  yourself .\nSo\nSo just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional .\n'Kay .\nAnd second , there should be some technological innovation . And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . And apparently , the fashion trends  are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme .\nUm but um the feel of the material should be spongy ,\nwhich is contrary to last year , apparently . I presume it must have been not not spongy last year .\nSo we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed .\nAnd then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that .  Right , so that'll be it .\nMaybe a banana or courgette or something .\nHow how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or you know , do they not matter that much ?\nI think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .\nWell you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 'cause you're can mis-direct people . And I would've thought the functionality  'cause the people get cheesed off by things  by having to read instructions et cetera , so .\nYeah .\nYeah .\n.. .\nMaybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . Maybe that could be a little apple .\nMaybe yeah .\nOkay . Now ? Yeah .\nAnd then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine ,\nand it wouldn't confuse the numbers .\nStand-by button . No th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality .\nMm-hmm .\nWell I dunno I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are ,\nBut what are they gonna be next  Yeah . What are they gonna be next year .\nmaybe\nYeah yeah .\nHmm . S\nBut but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh  I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever .\nMm-hmm . Yeah ,\nThat means you're constantly changing your production schedule ,\nI'm not\nand you've gotta make different moulds and everything else ,\nYeah .\nso that's not a good idea I would I would suggest .\nI'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . I don't know .\nI mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .\nYeah , yeah .\nto something which is maybe more universal .\nWell\nBut I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design ,\nMm-hmm .\num even if the design kind of changes ,\nMm-hmm .\nWe c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .\nAh d d But if\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um .\nMm-hmm . Well . Yep .\nMaybe still with a rubber design we could\nWas that in the sort of fashion sense that this  Or was  the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ? It was , wasn't it ?\nYeah .\nSo the\nIt seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons .\nYeah . Yeah .\nUm .\nAnd that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look .\nOh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .\nMm-hmm .\nUm oh no no no\nOh right , that fits , doesn't it ?\nsorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . That's the way round . If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . Which makes sense .\nRight .\nRubber buttons require rubber case .\nUm .\nAnd that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .\nMm-hmm .\nUh so , yeah . The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? 'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay  you want to basically mint them out\nMm-hmm .\n'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock\nMm-hmm .\nand therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle .\nYeah . Okay .\nYou're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand especially 'cause then you could make it something that\nI suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual\nMm-hmm .\nWell , you might be limited in space , that  yes .\nwould or not . Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWell you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine .\nHmm .\nYes yes .\nMaybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions\nlike the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhether that would just increase the costs ,\nHmm .\nmake it more complicated .\nSo you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing .\nThat's possibly it .\nYeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut you could change the the way it looked .\nYeah and then you could have  Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case ,\nYeah , that's true .\nbut you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .\nYeah you you could do a colour change , so therefore you would yeah yeah  I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in  rather than all in black\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nor , you know , which four do you want , as long as it's black ?\nHmm .\nBut uh so\nSo it is a possibility , um .\nBut we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ?\nYes oh that's true\nWe haven't really seen that yet\nOh okay yes\nuh that might no\nYeah .\nthat is\nIt might  and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things .\nWell not necessarily , because you could have your company uh  We're we're meant to be finishing up . You could have your company badge and logo . I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge\nMm-hmm .\nso what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing .\nMm-hmm .\n'Cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nAnd in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the uh the Windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nSo .\nAnd whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .\nHmm .\nWell if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well ,\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nYeah .\nand the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ?\nYeah , I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing but I'm  Yeah . I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . I think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , people see you with it all about and\nYeah I suppose ,\nwhere you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time .\ni if it\nIt's uh in in the house , isn't it , I suppose .\nYeah .\nOkay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case\nI think\nSo don't change case .\nMm-hmm .\nChange case colour . And we're sort of saying no to that .\nDid we decide on the rubber case ? The spongy feel , or did we think that that might go as a trend ?\nWell , it was different last year . The trend was different last year apparently . It was not not spongy feel . But  I don't know whether the trend will change . I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly ,\nYeah .\nwhereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know .\nYeah , less likely to\nSounds reasonable .   If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases\nSo then th th that would\nso that you could\nYeah .\nor 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .\nYeah .\nit seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case ,\nMm .\nand then have the standard rubber buttons as well .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nUm .\nUh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case . There's flat ,\nthere's single-curved and there's double-curved .\nUm . Mayb\nI'm not exactly sure what these things look like .\nMaybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine .\nWell it says that\nWhen you say d when you say double-curved , what what exactly does that mean ?\nI'm not exactly sure .  Um I'll show you the remotes that I've got .\nOkay .\nSee how uh  Let's just get that bigger . See how uh the one  Oh I'm not plugged in , am I ?\nNo you're not connected to me anymore .\nThat doesn't help .\nOne one thing to cons\nShall I just turn it round for time ?\none thing to consider is that in some ways you want um  by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other\nThat should come up .\ntherefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can  if you can store them up on top of each other .\nMm  .\nMm-hmm .\nWhereas if you do um fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that . And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product .\nYeah yeah .\nHmm .\nMm-hmm .\nSo shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to kind of\nSo but\nYeah .\nUm it's not very clear up there ,\nNo .\nbut you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there .\nMm yep .\nRight .\nI'm not exactl I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ?\nThat's what I was trying to work out .\nBut um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there .\nOh right . S so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ?\nShall we\nWe're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so .\nDefinitely a single , maybe a double .\n'Kay , so shall we quickly\nYeah .\nShall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?\nWe'll go for single curve , yeah .\nOkay ,\nSingle curve .\nOkay .\ncurved or double curved ? So it's single curved .\nSo did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? The one you move around ?\nYeah .\nYeah I think that think that's a good idea .\nYep .\nOkay . Um\nAnd the rubber push buttons , rubber case .\nRubber  Rubber buttons and case .\nUm and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we ,\nOh we ca\nbut possibly a sticker .\nYeah yeah , we'll still have the  Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? I th I think we can by by not having anything too complicated  .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . Without affecting the circuit board .\nYes . Yep .\nUm .\nYeah yeah .\nAnd see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to  that we seemed to leave out .\nOkay . And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit .  Or veg .\nYeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years . Uh what sort of shape do we want ?\nSo we've got spongy feel buttons as well , have we ?\nDon't know , maybe just\nAs well as  or w or was that\nYeah . That's ru rubber buttons , yeah .\nSo it's rubber buttons ,\nYeah , it was just\nso it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . With a rubber case right ?\n'Kay .\nYeah .\nYeah , so it's not too wacky .\nReasonably spongy I guess , yeah .\nAnd the standby button is gonna be different .\nYeah okay .\nUm I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape . If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird .\nOkay so what what shape are we making the standby button ?\nYeah  . Apple ?\nA apple .\nVote ?\nOh oh  Sorry ?\nYeah .\nShall we vote on it ?\nWe will go for the a a a apples apples .\nYeah .\nAnyone got any suggestions ?\nApple apple a a qu Quite a big one , as well .\nOkay . Ah .\nA big apple . Uh\nWell it could be red .\nCould be a red apple , yeah . Either , don't mind .\nA red apple ? Is it ?\nYeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , once we find out um\nOkay . And then we're gonna  are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? Just like the  Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time .\nMm-hmm .\nUm .\nYeah . Yeah that seems pretty straight forward .\nYeah .\n'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain .\n'Kay .\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nSorry what was that last thing again there ?\nUh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .\nRight  much option on that . I thought you were going for a single curve and\nAh just the uh shape of the buttons .\nAlright .\nAnd j yeah , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well . Fairly sort of self explanatory .\nYeah .\nRight , so shape of buttons simple . Okay . So that's that , I guess . We should now go away and get these things sorted out .  I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever .\nOkay .\nOkay , so um .\nIs that the end ?

Um  we have forty minutes . So it's now  Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .  It's a board decision .

Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um  then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .\nYes .\nIs that clear ?

Okay ,\nYes .\ngreat .\nUm  Oh , how can I uh  Geez , and sli and show . Um  Just uh press it .\nUh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .  Uh the method of the remote control is just  the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .\nYeah .\nThen I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .\nYeah .\nUm but um  yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh  the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh  it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than  less than forty years old .\nUh-huh .\nSo maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so .

Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .\nUm basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,\nEnergies and uh\nbut it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?\nNo , it's not visible .\nNo ? Well  Um , there's a energy source here .  And um basically there  it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .  Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that .  It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .\nYeah .\nThere are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w\nThe glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .\nyes . In the  and it's a little more  a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that .\nYeah . Okay .\nOkay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .  So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .\nSo it's fairly easy .\nThere's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before ,\nOkay .\nSucceed in it also .\nand I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this .\nOkay ,\nSo   Okay , so uh\ngood .\npersonally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear .\nOkay .\nUh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .\nOkay .\nAnd um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .\nAnd what's the um\nI think our uh users will really uh will really like that .\nif we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or\nNo , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .\nOkay .\nSo we can use them . So that's no problem .\nFor the same costs , it's can be uh in our\nUh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making\nCombined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh\nWe can we can make its I think .\nWell you could only lit uh the buttons  the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .\nOr\nOkay .\nBut I think\nHmm .\nYeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,\nHmm , true .\nand not for\nYes . Well , it's not one light , it  there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .\nYeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .\nNo no no , no . That's right , that's right .\nOkay .\nSo  well , this uh should be it .\nOkay .\nUm have a think about it .\nYeah . Okay , Ruud .\nOh , mine is already outdated .\nOkay well ,\nwe ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .\nSince uh\nSo any income is welcome .  Input .\nOkay , make  Well  Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of   of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .\nOkay .\nCould you step a little bit more to the right ?  Yeah , thank you .\nBut um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .\nUh well , skip this .\nYeah .\nWell , it's  this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the  about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .\nMm .\nSo we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .\nOkay . Well , that's interesting .\nOr\nOr a find  a finding function ,\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nyou know .\nthat's definitely interesting .\nThat's quite a  yes .\nIt uh it separates our product from others uh as well .\nSound signal .\nYeah .\nOkay ,\nYeah .\ngo on .\nYes .\nWell , I just said that . And uh  well , this obvious , and he also said it .\nOkay . So that's what the market tells us .\nUh that's about it , yes .\nYep . Okay .\nThe volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .\nUh mo uh zap buttons most .\nSo\nVolume , they are  uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So\nYeah , well it should just have a design  The perfect design for those  only those buttons . And first um\nYes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .\nYeah .\nYep .\nWell , the technical uh  there  I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .\nYeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering ,  the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?\nWell\nYeah , that's uh   a problem . Yeah .\nYes .  Th that's a bit of  that's a problem .\nAnother device is not a solution .\nWell\nUsually\nmaybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,\nIt should be uh uh\nlike um turning on and off the the the lights .\nOh yes .\nYeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .\nYes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep .\nReports rep respend response to it .\nAnd um\njust like uh the phones Yeah ,\nYes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing .\nthe\nYeah .\nBut uh th\nBut but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh\nNo , so we we should use something else .\nAnd you\nYeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um\nBut I believe you will have an\nYeah , and usually\nWe do not control the T_V_ set so well .\nAnd even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,\nYes , m yes . S and we b we want  to make so it's   is easy as possible for our customers ,\nand it's\nOkay .\nso we should think about\nSo what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se\nI'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .\nIt's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .\nAnd b\nWell , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh\nYes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,\nYeah , a peak . Yeah .\nwhich is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .\nYeah .\nBut there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .\nSo if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .\nYeah , that's true .\nYes ,\nBut we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something .\nso we don't want that .\nMaybe we can  Something like that .\nWell if you lost th\nWell ,\nWell uh\nis there not something f something more easily\nI don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the  their remote .\nWell , I don't think uh  .\nUh that's just uh\nNo , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh  . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,\nYeah .\nso w we should use have  uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .\njust a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .\nYes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think .\nYeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .\nSo that's not a good idea .\nYeah .\nUm maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,\nMm-hmm . I will .\nYeah .\nbecause that's his  his field of expertise .\nYes . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated\nMm-hmm .\num and it will become more costly also .\nYep .\nBecause there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp\nAnd do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?\nWell , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .\nIt's a unique item uh\nYeah , it's a distinction in the market .\nSo\nIt will be an  a unique feature of our remote control .\nIt's a different  exactly . It's an uni an unique feature ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and  probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "infrared, devices, device, remote, communicate", "dialogue_id": 12}, {"text": "And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .\nYeah .\nWhat should we choose in in design ?\nYeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .\nWell , the extra functions .\nSo\nI have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .\nOkay .\nWell , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most  the second-most used function .\nUsed option .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nWell , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that .\nUh well  yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .\nYeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .\nSo  Yeah . Yeah .\nWell , we skip that .\nSo\nOkay .\nWell , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff .\nNo , no .\nNo .\nSo\nNope .\nSo that's out of the question .\nYeah .\nYeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .\nSo\nUh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .\nI think also . Yes . Well ,\nNo .\nSo\nwe should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface\nYeah . Okay ,\nand\nRuud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple\nUh well if we um include other uh innovative functions   uh then they uh might ,\nMm-hmm .\n'cause young people uh like new features .\nMm yeah .\nSo\nYeah , that's right .\nOkay , so this is is kind of uh\nMm .\nUh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .\nOkay . Well , is it  maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions .\nYeah .\nMaybe it's more important to make the  make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless\nBut but are we not in in the in the manual uh  I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .\nBut but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?\nYeah , I don't know yet .\nBecause we do not implement uh a user history .\nMm-hmm . There's  no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system .\nI know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um\nW Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .\nAnd if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .\nYeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .\nYes .\nBut does it  uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well ,\nYeah , draw draw it on the board .\nshould we just use a  Um it's already uh  oh , we have a blank . Oh .\nyeah , something like that . Oh\nIt's just an easy uh way of of a round button what  which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick .\nIt's not really a stick , but  Yes . Yes .\nA stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down\nYeah , it can break down .\nHmm .\nor uh\nYes , yes .\njust a round uh button should be the trick , I think .\nYeah .\nAnd  Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think .\nYeah .\nI think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think .\nA younger uh  Huh .\nBut you're the marketing man .\nAnd it's also quite easy to use , so it'll  it  uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .\nGeez . Well , volume and something uh like that .\nUh-huh .\nThe programme up and down .\nOkay , yeah .\nAnd the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .\nOkay , that's good .\nOkay , but w we still  we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .\nMm-hmm .\nBut I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's  um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have  has the information to discuss about that , I think .\nUm well , for  we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah .\nYes ?\nWe need to um have the uh the user function  uh the functions decided and um  uh our target audience .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nbut teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'Kay ,\nOkay . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?\nUm well , I do not want a full uh  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .\nOkay . Okay .\nThe ten digits .\nMm-hmm .\nWell , for example , that that's what we should think about .  l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but\nOh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change\nMm-hmm . Yes .\nYeah . A bit of a split mode .\nChange .\nUh l like  Yeah .\nyeah .\nYes , yes .\nDual channel watch .\nYes .\nOkay , well um\nYeah .\nm maybe I should write that down .\nWell\nyou're the secretary .\nUh Ruud , um what's your last name ?\nMielsen .\nMielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh  Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um\nMm okay ,\nAlright .\nbut make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already .\nYeah , that's that's\nYeah .\nif you want to do it , Sebastian .\nOur B_S_C_ uh W_ uh\nSure .   .\nOkay , um   Okay , so so um   uh\nVolume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh\nYes , that's important .\nAnd and do we want um the ten digits ?\nThe ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so .\nWell , are are you sure ?\nWell , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .\nI'm not so sure .\nYeah .\nWell , that's complicated ,\nYeah .\nbut is that so relevant ? Because I don't think  but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so .\nI wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits .\nOkay ,\nUh and I think the most\nI can imagine when\nI agree actually .\nJust elder elder people would would buy it ,\nI can imagine when you're  when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .\nWell\nbut\nBut if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh    you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .\nBut we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .\nBut\nYep . The older people only use five of them .\nWell ,\nYeah ,\nbut how how often do you watch all these channels ?\nand if if we  And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .\nOften .\nNo , you're probably right .\nSo\nYeah .\nOkay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?\nWell , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the\nThe design .\nOn the design .\nOkay . Well , y then there should be  should done  be done something specific with it .\nWell\nYou c  you can d make them very fancy\nAnd\nby um   I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I'm I'm  I do not agree\nYeah .\nOkay , so you can experiment by  uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .\nExactly , exactly .\nOkay .\nAnd um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for\nOkay , speech .\nWell , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .\nYeah .\nSo um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing .\nYeah .\nAnd it's very easy uh to find your remote control .\nTo find  yeah .\nSo maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly .\nYeah .\nUh  If if we would um drop the ten digits\nBut maybe when we uh\nbut keep the programme and the volume ,\nMm-hmm .\nbecause maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um\nOkay . Okay , okay .\nEspecially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but\nYeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .\nOkay .\nYes .\nWell . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .\nSo\nOkay .\nwe have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .\nYes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button  uh remote control function .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nSo that's that's a big advantage , I think .\nOkay , g good .\nOkay .\nThere's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .\nMm .\nBut maybe can  we we can think something smart about it .\nYep .\nThere are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .\nOkay .\nSo when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .\nBut  But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?\nYou have to do nothing for it .\nM\nTwelve dollar fifty .\nBecause it seems like a very\nMaybe , maybe not .\nAnd uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .\nI'll have to find that out . Yes . So  No , that's very cheap .\n'Cause when\nIs a cradle very cheap ?\nIt's  Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .\nI know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .\nIt's  Yes , but they're they're mass production .\nYeah .\nThey're very cheap .\nOkay .\nSo it will cost us p practically nothing .\nOkay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um  I would like to hear um  maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?\nUm I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .\nOkay .\nBut with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So  I don't think that's a big problem\nOkay . Okay , so\nYeah .\nalthough we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh  Profitable . We we  yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .\nYes . Yeah , profitable .\nProfitable .\nOkay .\nYes .\nO okay .  Um Roo .   Nothing to add .\nI have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .\nSebastian ?\nUm I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um\nYeah ? Great .\nso uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one  the  those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that  these kinds of things .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nUm it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving .\nYep .\nUh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not  do not implement these buttons .  If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another\nYeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board\nwell , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that  we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .\nYeah .\nAnd this even uh makes it more cheapy .\nBut the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?\nMm-hmm .\nThe board .\nThe circuit board .\nThe circuit board .\nThe fewer buttons you can use on it .\nNo , it's th\nThe fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .\nyeah .\nYeah , okay .\nIt's the other way around , yeah .\nYeah .\nAnd it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage .\nIt shouldn't be a big issue .\nWell it  then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh  especially for the voice recognition .\nSo  Yes , because I don't know  Yes . I d I really don't know . So\nNo .\nOkay .\nIt can be costly . Maybe not .\nI'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that .\nYes .\nUm I'm not sure how how that\nYes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh  have a lo uh look at it .\nYep .\nOkay , great . Um  well , I think we're qui quite done .\nWe're done , I think .\nUm for now we will have the lunch break .\nHow nice .\nUm I'm  don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out .\nMe neither .\nUm then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um  the Interface Designer , um I would like to  the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept .\nInterface  industrial .\nUh  I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry .\nYeah .\nUser Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept .\nWell , we understand .\nAnd um\nUh the only problem is it  that it depends on the divisions  the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition .\nWell\nWell , i it should be easy ,\nWell\nthat's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um  um yeah , some some fancy lights .\nMm yes .\nYeah .\nI think that's what we decided .\nSo we drop the voice recognition ?\nNo no no , we didn't\nOr\nbut it shouldn't be integrated\nOh .\nyeah , it's  of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the\nOkay . Well um do we really have to decide now\nNo .\nor can we decide next meeting ?\nWe can decide the next meeting . Yep .\nOkay . Because I'll have some updated info on that uh\nYeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching .\nYep .\nAnd I'm sure the market will um uh   uh will change , adapt\nHmm .\nAdapt .\nAdapt .\nLeft .\nand um so\nHmm .\nwe will see that .

So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . So it should be , of course , new and original , and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . That mean it's a very challenging project , and uh uh . So w it's  we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy .

So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . Um . Yeah and everything is  will be like this . Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all  during all this project . So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here .

So uh   So I will ask you all to do the same .\nOkay .\nJust to get used to the whiteboard .\nSo probably I would try to try to draw the animal . Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ?\nYeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course  .\nI I th I think I should .\nYeah go ahead .\nOkay , so . Um  . Okay , American , um . Um . I would use the bird . So I tried to sketch it out . I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah . Can you recognise it  as a bird ?\nOkay  it's your turn to\nOkay , okay .  So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat .\nOh .\nThat's its head .\nUm I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful .\nOkay .\nI dunno if I should go with this   .\nOh it's okay .\nThanks .\nIf it is enough line .\nMaybe put it up\nI'm sorry .\nPut it a Maybe put it on the desk or something .\nYeah .\nI should get used to the tool , so .\nOkay .\nOh just wait  a little bit . C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ?\nAh probably not .\nThey should be remote .\nOkay , it  it works like this .\nUh , that's better .\nOkay , thanks .\nYour lapel microphone's fallen off .\nAre you left-handed ?\nNo .\nOh , pity  .\nOkay . Should I clean ?\nOkay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can .  Oh  .\nNever mind .\nAh , it's maybe better if you leave it .\nYeah . Yeah . Maybe we should just continue .\nYeah .\nYeah , don't worry about it .\n, no worry .\nNo .\nOkay .\nYou won't draw them , or ?\nYou can draw it , if you want .\nI dunno if I can .\nJust try . I would like to see how it looks like .\nOkay .\nIt may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever .\nI'm not good very good in drawing . Okay , so this is very   It's a bird , I think .

So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . Anything .\nOkay .\nWell , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very  they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um .\nMm .\nOh .\nSo it's frustrated me in the past , th that .\nOkay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light  , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light .\nYeah .\nAnd maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this . And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh  there are two buttons for volume control .\nYeah .\nBut I prefer like a potential-meter or something like .\nAh , okay . Okay .\nYou know , some slider or\nOkay .\nNot just two discrete buttons for volume ,\nMm-hmm .\nOkay , n\nbut something which\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nIs that because the  of the discrete volume levels , or is that\nYeah , but I can reach  In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume .\nAre you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could   the the volume can go up very quickly\nYeah .\nAh , n .\nand it can\nIf it drops to the floor then it starts to scream  .\nYeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and\nYeah , f It depends what what you feel about that .\nyou have a heart attack  . Okay .\nYeah .\nYeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if  you have some more notes on that .\nYeah so you can\nUh I  Yeah ,\nDo you have something ?\njust a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune  .\nYeah , that's true .

Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um   Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of  our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think  looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um  so actually I think  Yeah um f  you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of\nOkay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your  to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes\nYou could change the vegetable , or fruit .\nyeah , I can change the vegetable .\nOh is that broccoli ?\nThis one's broccoli  .\nYeah .\nSo this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango .\nThe  it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .\nYou don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but\n'S a very bright strawberry .\nSo we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .\nIt's been a l\nIt's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .\nMm-hmm .\nOh yeah .\nAnd I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was  or design yet actually , would be the um thing  the locator . How how  so\nWell the locator is just chip that's inside there .\nOkay so that's just\nAnd the beeper's also inside there too somewhere\nSo you have to have a button on your on your  you have to attach the button to the\nYeah we didn't design that .\nYeah we have  that that has yes yet to be designed .\nBut it would be coordinating with that of course .\nYeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYou could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango .\nSo . Tada .\nOh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there .  But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed\nI mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um   I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be\nMy impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .\nOh . Okay .\nBut it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and  d I dunno what that means .\nRight .\nOne side is curved and then the other side is curved .\nWell  yeah . If we're talking about the area just  oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .\nUm so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?\nMm-hmm .\nUm and lots of special colours actually .  Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ?\nNo I think that's alright .\nOkay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .\nAnd if we sold a lot of squishy things .\nMm .\nBoo yeah . Okay .  S So  Mm . Did y what did you work on ? The\nUm evaluation criteria .\nOkay . Do you wanna\nI've got a presentation .\nOkay . I think that's\nSo I need  where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't  okay . Um the method is  we  well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is  everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And  we we have therefore in total um  We have five  we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?\nMm-hmm .\nUm so the que the questions I've given you  c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .\nI dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .\nYeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own\nYeah it's in the um  it's in the project documents .\nIs it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes .\nIt's called evaluation criteria .\nOkay .\nAnd it's under evaluation .\nHuh , the PowerPoint one ?\nHmm ?\nOkay . Cool .\nYeah . You've found it all ?\nYeah .\nSo it was um  Yeah true's one .\nTrue's one and false is seven .\nDo you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?\nUm we can do it separately and then discuss it\nYeah okay .\nif if that's what people wanna do .\nSo it's actually a scale .\nWait , one is true and\nUm ,\nso these are the questions we're answering . And one is\nyes it's  if it's fancy you put one ,\nOne , right okay .\nif it's really unfancy it's seven .\nIf it's somewhere in between you put four .\nYeah , something .\nOkay .\nOkay .  Does it feel fancy ?\nFeels like play-dough .\nNo .\nThey shouldn't really be questions . Should be more like  Are the batteries easy to insert ?\nI'm gonna say yes .\nYes ? Very very true . Okay .\nI imagine they're somewhere on the front . We have a little case that you slip 'em in .\nOkay .\nAre we just about ready ?\nApparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we  um is it necessary ?\nI don't think so . It's\nWe'll just do um\nyeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we\nYeah . Okay .\nOur animals will forever be there .\nYeah . Okay .\nUn unless you feel you need it t to\nI don't feel any\nokay okay .\nWe'll\nright um  Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle .\n'Kay\nOne .\nFive .\nRight . Ooh I don't know .\nRight . One ?\nFive .\nFive .\nFive .\nTwo . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ?\nI I think we should\nIt's four if you wanna do that .\nYeah .\nYeah ?\nYeah .\nIt adds to sixteen , so that's four .\nOh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two .\nOh I thought she said five .\nHmm .\nOne five five two is thirteen , over four for now . I think that's um  next ?\nUm three .\nSix .\nSix .\nReally ?\nYeah .\nTwo .\nI wasn't cheating I swear .\nUh-oh . Right . One point three is\nSo it's a one was true and seven was false ?\nUh .\nHuh ?\nOkay , so you guys really didn't like it ?\nYeah .\nOh I thought it was the other way round .\nWait a minute .\nI really\nI thought it was the other way round too .\nSo we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way\nWell uh\nSh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top  .\nYeah yeah . It was one is true and  false is seven .\nI should've kept the table up .\nOh gosh . Okay . Well\nI'll just I'll just reverse them all . It's no problem .\nYeah .\nRight , well I'm glad this came out .\nYeah .\nI thought you guys hated it .\nI was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nNo .  Oh that's quite funny  .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nOkay . So , starting again , one point one ?\nOne .\nSay two .\nThree .\nTwo . Okay , one point two ?\nUh three .\nTwo .\nTwo .\nTwo . Okay . Um , one point three ?\nOne .\nOne .\nOne .\nHa .  Two point one ?\nTwo .\nUh two .\nUh two .\nTwo point  I think I missed two .  Wait , is that two point one ?\nYeah I put it down as one point four for some reason .\nYeah .\nOne point four , one point five . Okay right\nOh dear , okay . Sorry .\nthat's  I have two of them .\nMine has all kinds of problems .\nTwo and one .\nSorry about that . T two point two , which is one point five .\nOne .\nUh three . Wait why did I put three ?\nUh one .\nI meant one on mine too .\nOkay . Three point one . Is that correct on my slide ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah ?\nUh one .\nThree point one . I have four .\nThree .\nOne , four , three , three , three point two ?\nThree .\nThree .\nUh . One .\nThree point three .\nOne .\nOne .\nTwo .\nFour point one ?\nOne .\nTwo .\nFive .\nTwo . Four point two .\nTwo .\nThree .\nFour .\nTwo and four point three .\nTwo .\nOne , two .\nOne .\nTwo .\nRight so I put one on that .\nOkay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue .\nOkay .

It  or bigger ?\nI think the wheel would probably be  mm .\nBecause\nWhat if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?\nAnd like then it  you could hold it in your hand better .\nI think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish .\nYeah . No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get  that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThe flat one . Yeah .\nso c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .\nYeah .\nUm but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .\nI didn't  yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat\nWell if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . Mm .\nBut it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah .\nYeah . And would it even resemble fruit that way ?\nI mean\nYeah like certain ones  you'd have to limit the fruit selection ,\nYeah .\nlike you could probably do a strawberry still .\nYeah .\nI think the broccoli would be out .\nYou could do  , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like  sorta like a joystick .\nYeah that I I  when you were holding that before , it actually looked  yeah .\nYeah . That looked really good .\nI don't know . So\nAre there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?\nUh .\nNot that I can think of . Rhubarb .\nRhubarb .\nI think that broccoli is my favourite actually .\nThese obscure fruits .\nYeah .\nUh despite the\nI think we needn't\nWhat if um the  it was just patterns on like  we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .\nHuh ?\nYou know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .\nOh okay .\nSo it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .\nYeah . That could work .\nYeah .\nOr I mean we could even have fruit like around\nYeah .\nI mean\nYeah . I dunno .\nBut if we if we need\nYeah and just have the colour match or something .\nyeah . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be\nI mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the\nYeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .\nMm .\nMm .\nOr like  I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think  see as like\nlike you could  if it was only this  you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo like maybe that's just too big\nWell see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that ,\nbecause\nwhich is a nice kind of\nYeah it's sorta like a joystick .\nYeah .\nyeah . But\nI dunno .\nI mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ?\nI guess\n'Cause like kind of\nWe could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOr like even\nDif\nWe went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .\nOr even like  Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?\nYeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do  I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .\n'Cause that , I think  I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea .\nYeah .\nAnd you still have the comfort of holding it like that .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nMm .\nAnd you could  like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .\nYeah . Yeah . Alright .\nBut I mean it  do we have any other ideas about that ?\nUm\nWe could tr I don't know .\nThink the critical ones came out to be  yeah that one .  . Batteries easy to insert for some reason ,\nwhich can be easily  I think that's not a problem any more .\nThe batteries are going in the back ?\nThat  everyone gave that a one or a two . Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .\nNo .\nThe reason I I ga I didn't give it a one  I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip\nNo I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door ,\nno you could  Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .\nyeah um like on a normal remote .\nRight .\nSo it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .\nOkay .\nI think everyone's under three anyway .\nMm .\nSo I think it's  yeah those are the only two points .\nCool . Well  Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .\nYeah I'd agree with changing the shape .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nUm , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff .\nWe were a bit off task .\nUm so uh I can't think of any  So we'll have to like   Mm .\nYeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like ,\nIt might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .\nbut you could do like  Yeah that's true .\nYeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .\nYeah . Yeah that's true . Mm .\nI bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .\nYeah .

Well the problem is if you don't  like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it .

I never use it .\nYeah but uh\nI can't say I found everything particularly helpful .

Yeah .\nAs if you'd wanted to .\nYeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um\nSystem . Yeah .\na whole system ,\n'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the\nYeah .\nYeah I mean , it\nWell I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah , huh .\nIt seems planned you know .\nYeah .\nYeah I kinda thought that um  I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated\nbecause\nYeah .\nI dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time .

Maybe we are .\nMm .\nI don't know .\nUh I think , and I think that uh all this technology like  I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes ,\nYeah .\nWell the thing is , like I actually worked in a company ,\nor like  I dunno .\nand I had a role and I had to go to meetings . And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . Like usually I missed meetings deliberately .\nThere's just  there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company .\nYeah .\nIt's mostly like rehashing old stuff .\nHm .\nAnd you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know .\nYeah .\nIt's like the  there's just really not a lot of information that goes through .\nSeems kind of like an excessive reiteration .\nIt seems like way overkill .\nYeah .\nLike if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence .\nYeah .\nI wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and\nYeah .\nI guess it would be  it's gotta be worth it to  I  'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno .

First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of  'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes .\n'Kay . Oh , well let's go ahead and ,\nback , previous .\nSo what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . Who would like to start us off ? 'Kay .\nI don't mind going first .\nOkay . Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ?\nYeah , it's in the  should be in the m Project .\nOkay .\nDo you want us to do our PowerPoints now or\nYou know you could you could do it yourself actually .\nOh .\nDid you send it ?\nSave it in the project documents .\nPut it in Project Documents ,\nOkay .\nyeah .\nMm-mm-mm . This one ?\nSure .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nOkay . Great .\nOkay . Um well , the function  of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus .  And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .\nAnd we can decide if that's what we want ,  , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .\nOkay . Okay .\nThese are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons ,\nand I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is  fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating .\nRight .\nAnd you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . Okay .\nReady .\nAnd then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place .\nSo that's it .\nAlright .

Functional requirements .\nMm yes .\n'Kay . Alright . Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .\nYes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the  users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Seventy five percent think they're ugly . Eighty percent want  they've  are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they  it needs to be snazzy and it  but yet simple .\nWait .\nSo that's really what we need to do . And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So\nAnd that meaning what ?\nLike  They like I guess use the buttons a lot .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nI don't know . It's from my uh research .\nOkay , what do you m\nRight .\nMy team wasn't very clear .\nOh , I'm sorry .\nOnly use ten percent of the buttons .\nWhat do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .\nThat's okay . I I think it's like the engineering versus user ,\nOkay .\nwhereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex\nOh , right .\nand users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .\nThe buttons .

And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time ,\nHmm .\nmuch like any small appliance like a cellphone ,\nLost .\nand they  we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go  we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote ,\nS\nbut I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .\nIt's okay . It's very important .\nYes , it is important for the remote control world .\nWait , is that like your  ergonomics like your hand movements or something ?\nSh\nCould be , yeah .\nUh possibly .\nDo we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?\nLike\nOh .\nUh yeah , that's what my web site said , I\nChannel , volume , power .\nI think that's a pretty good guess though .\ndon't know .\nYeah , I would assume so .\nIt's like if you're holding it\nI think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts .\nYeah . It's okay .\nBut also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones .\nOkay . Next slide ?\nYes . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .\nUser-friendly .\nWhere the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in  like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product .\nAnd also we found  our team found that speech recognition is  it's like an up-and-coming thing they really  consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it .\nAnd so just to  just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ?\nI guess so , yeah .\nOkay .\nto just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know .\nOh , that'd be lovely .\nYeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme .\nYeah .\nDidn't they  um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would  the remote would beep so if you have lost it\nIt's kinda like what the remote phone used to do .\nMm . Oh , yeah , that's true .\nYou know like go to the base .\nWe could definitely include that if we wanted to .\nYeah .\nIf it's within our price . Okay . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ?", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remotes, buttons, controls, remote, functionality", "dialogue_id": 16}, {"text": "Yeah , I'm just trying to move it .\nOkay .\n'Kay . I think it should be there , working design .\nWorking design .\nThere we go .\n'Kay .\n'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating .\nOh my bad .\nOh that's fine .\nUh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this .\nHelp me .\nWe need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .\nWhat exactly is a smart chip ?\nUsually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions .\nWell , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ?\nI wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay . Ready ?\nUm yep , nothing here .\nThat's okay .\nUm power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself .\nUm a large on-off button ,  demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good .\nHmm .\nSelection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . Um smart chip that perverts  uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it .\nUh this is my fifty second design .\nPower source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .\nSo what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?\nThis is just like a rough schematic .\nSo this would be the front ?\nSo this is the internal workings .\nSo the red would be the front of the remote though , right ?\nOh okay .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance .\nThe l  the light up kind of\nYeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red ,\nLike that we know the battery's working .\nYeah .\n'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ?\nHmm . It'd probably be lighting up the key too ,\nOkay .\nWe can skip that whole thing .\nright ?\nYep .\n'Kay .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo you can put it in the dark .\nThe buttons .\nYeah , and that's good .\nOkay .\nWe should make it glow in the dark .\nYeah , definitely . 'Kay nex R Ready ?\nYeah , that's it .\n'Kay , any p 'Kay ?\nMm 'kay .\nAnything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ?\nI think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons .\nJust\nOkay .\nWell , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?\nI think we should . Like I think that would be in a as in  like in  for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons ,\nMm .\nI think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .\nOvals . Yeah , yeah .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "chip, chips, smart, programmed, devices", "dialogue_id": 16}, {"text": "Okay . Okay , let's talk about all of our  We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and  I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier .  Wait , come back . Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo .\nOkay .\nIt's not gonna be multi-functional .\nHey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . We're trying to get our name out there in the world . Okay .\nAnd you know what teletext is ?\nYeah .\nin States we don't have it , but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports ,\nI know .\nWhat is it ?\nit's very um bland looking , it's just text on the screen ,\nYeah ,\nnot even\nit's like black , black and white kind of\nYeah , just black with just text .\nLike running along the bottom ?\nYeah .\nYou can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so\nIt'll give you the sports .\nWait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ?\nKind of .\nExcept the entire screen .\nYeah it's the whole screen .\nIt's the entire screen is just running information at random .\nSo anyway\nYou can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment ,\nSeemingly .\nyou know it's like\nRight .\nSo it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ?\nRight . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet .\nYeah .\nNobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news ,  and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so  Those are our new product requirements . Alright . Mm-hmm .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nSo , do we have to include the company colour within that ?\nYes . It's part of the logo . Okay .\nCompany colour being yellow .\nWhat we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright .  Whatever . Okay . So our target group is  You mentioned um older people ? Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ?\nMm-hmm .\nBecause I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically\nIt's gonna make it nicer . Yeah .\nnon-technically challenged people are gonna use it . I mean they want something user-friendly , so\nMm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra ,\nYeah .\n'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them ,\nYeah .\nthen we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons .\nOkay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ? Or kids ?\nNo , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think .\nMost of them will intuitively pick it up though .\nThey gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network .\nOkay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range\nYeah , I think we need it all .\nUm what about technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ?\nUm I would say we should say dumber than the average person .\nOkay .\nWe should go for the lowest denominator .\nYeah .\nRight , okay . So so they need no technical experience to operate\nHigh school educated .\nhow 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no .\nOkay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes .\nWell it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute .\nMm-hmm , volume .\nAnd channel . Yeah . Those are the most important ones .\nRight . And we wanna keep um  I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . Correct , because people only use ten percent .\nYeah .\n'Kay . Hey , what else ?\nUm .\nUm .\nDo we want this thing to be able to be found easily ?\nI think so . What do you\nSure , yeah .\nA finding kind of device or\nAnd\nI need  we we need a like homing device .\nYeah , ho homing device .\nlike if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?\nOh right yeah okay .\nMm 'kay .\nTracking .\nOkay .\nBecause people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech .\nRight .\nWhat if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .\nBut you got a base .\nDo you think people'll really go for that though ?\nIt's useful for the remote phone .\nBecause\nHmm .\nYeah .\nWould that add to our costs at all , I wonder ?\nI would think so , because you'd have to develop a base .\nRight .\nWell , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nRechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .\nYeah .\nOkay . I I think we can make a decision about that later . Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . So that would include battery source  Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .\nRight .\nWell , then we could\nDo w\nIf we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .\nMm .\nWell , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge\nYou could um  we could hook it up .\nIt wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black ,\nOh .\nbut all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So  basically older people don't really care .\nIt's really the people twenty five to thirty five . I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though .\nMm-hmm .\nThey're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and\nAnd if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has\nWell\njust sitcoms and stuff . Right .\nWell , then then do you put the voice recognition  do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote ,\nSo\n'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote ,\nRight .\nwhereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .\nYeah .  and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .\nRight .\nA certain phrase then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there .\nYeah .\nWell\nStill  fifteen minutes .\nOkay , anything else we wanna discuss ?\nUm . Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ?\nUm .\nWait , on the remote itself ?\nYeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero .\nHow how ,\nWell , we definitely need those .\nyeah , how would you leave those out ?\nYeah .\nWell , I don't know , I mean , if you can  like well\nUnless you could say the channel .\nI don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ?\nI think people would find that too foreign .\nYeah , that's true .\nYeah .\nAnd also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too .\nYou definitely need\nI used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty .  So I couldn't  whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ .\nIt's when we get satellite .\nMm .  get your own remote , or digital cable .\nYeah .\n'Kay . Um . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um .\nYeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so\n'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .\nThe colour being yellow ?\nWait .\nI'm guessing . And the R_R_ .\nAnd how do we\nI feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish .\nR_ the double R_ .\nWe could just have the logo in yellow ,\nCan't make it entirely\nor maybe a yellow light for the keys .\nOr is the l\nOr put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights .\nYeah ,  yellow could be and it could  doesn't have to be huge .\nWell if you have like a\nYeah .\nHang on . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom  the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ .\nRight . So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind ,\nRight , yeah .\nor no menu buttons .\nYeah .\nSo we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers  Yeah .\nYeah .\nUm can we go back to  I'm gonna look really quickly back at those\nTwo examples .\nexamples and see if there is anything .\nYeah .\nWhich one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ?\nOh , it's a  Yeah .\nOkay .\nYeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?\nThe T_V_ . I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ?\nWell , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use .\nHmm .\nand so it's like\nYeah , 'cause we need to  we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful .\nCouldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language ,\nI don't  well , I don't know .\nyou know ?\nRight .\nSo we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons .\nFor the menus .\nWell , that could be  No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nThat's true .\nChannel is just up and down .\nYeah , okay . Okay , yeah .\nAnd then add a\nSomething that looks mayb you know .\nSuch as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one .\nY right , right right right .\nYeah .\nThat one ?\nSo we just have it like  add a menu button then for the various things needed ,\nRight .\nincluding v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now\nIn the middle perhaps .\nincluded in the menu .\nYep .\nOoh , I just got an idea for a design .\ngood .

So\nthat's my name ,  . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to  uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . So um the  thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things  or , not yet ,\nYes .\nokay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly  that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it  that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for  what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever .  Okay so  uh no , this is a  these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . And you already saw  you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .\nFolder ,\nFolder , okay .\nyes .\nSo no okay  have a look at that one . Okay . So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read .  You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard\nand um and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have  this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . Yes ?\nAh I can see it now .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nThis a new page , it's okay . Use pen format . and a different colour can use here  no I just take the pink . You take  oh there's no pink , okay , oh just purple , okay .\nPurple .\nNo blue . And uh line width  ten . Okay uh just take  what I'm going to draw is an elephant . Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . It's a very nice elephant , you can see . I dunno what it looks  but it doesn't matter .\nLooks very nice .\nI just h\nSomething like this ? Oh no\nIt look like a dinosaurs .\nYeah , okay .\nA pink elephant .\nBecause I like  uh okay .\nJust takes so long , okay . Whatever , just . You erased this one . It's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying .\nOkay .\nOkay , so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . Just don't\nLet me try one .\num  yeah , just u use it like that , yeah . That's okay .\nOkay .\nMm . Okay and then uh what's the colour ? How do I do\nIt's in format . Yeah .\nAh . I'll take this one . Uh there has to be water ,\nJust\nbut\nNo it has to be an animal , so if that's it's  it should be a shna snake or something .\nYeah yeah , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water .\nOkay . Okay okay . Okay .\nThe water is important .\nOkay .\nSo I first uh draw the water .\nUh . Okay , and now I make the animal . It's a fish .\nOkay ,\nWow .\ncool .\nMm-hmm . So .  Um\nThis is a worm .\nHmm yeah , that's nice .\nWow .\nOkay , who next ? Uh\nUh do you have to write down why  uh that doesn't matter , just  it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay .\nOkay .\nJust make a new blank new blank page .\nYeah .\nWell Paul ?\nYeah . Like this ?\nYeah , not too far to the to the t pen top .\nOkay . Um\nlet's make it um a dog . Ooh .\nMaybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that  no , to the  yeah .\nAh okay .\nI think it's a pig .\nA pig ?\nNo , it's a dog .\nI can make\nOr a dog .\na dog .\nUm\nA sheep ?\nUh we d only have twenty five minutes , so  .\nTake it easy .\n'Kay , I make a cat of it .\nI I was gonna make a cat too .\nUse your fantasy .\nOh , not too quick .\nJust hold it more more to the back then you don't have\nNo\nokay .\nI have it . I just draw too quick I think . Okay , that's it . More .\nNo , that's okay , thank you .\nIt's just to get used to it .\nOkay .\nI thought these pens would be just um  uh you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? No , not yet , okay .\nNo .\nYeah , that's right ,\nBut it's just\nit  but you actually got to write on the paper .\nSorry ?\nYou really got to write on that paper .\nYeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word ,\nYeah yeah , it's a real pen .\nso that's not\nYeah , but it's just a picture .\njust  it's just a picture . So\nOh .\nit's not that cool as I th thought it would be .\nYou really\nY you can you can't edit in the  edit it in Word .\nNo .\nNo .\nOh , okay .\nIt's a donkey .\nI don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure .\nUh I think it was uh\nHalf past .\nHalf past ten .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nBrilliant .\nOkay , perfect .\nNice , eh ?\nYep .\nYeah , thank you .

Okay ,\nExcuse me .\nthat's  . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,\nPiece of cake .\nsorry .\nUh easy .\nSo can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have  a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the  and everything , so just have a look how it  we think about remote controls .\nYeah , my first question was does it have to be a  a universal remote control ?\nOh yeah , that's a good question .\nBecause we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .\nI think it's  I'm not I'm not sure ,\nSo I\nit's not mm  I think\nYeah , it probably would be universal .\nUniversal .\nBecause\nAnd only television ? Or more devices ?\nI don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so  not sure , but\nHmm , maybe , I don't know .\nYeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros\nOkay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect .\nAh okay .\nYeah , I think .\nAnd uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player\nYeah , everything\nand\njust  so a lot of buttons  on the remote control .\nokay .  Yeah , probably .\nNot just a T_V_ .\nNo , just everything .\nOkay .\n. so yeah ,\nOkay .\nwhat what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not  nothing very special , but um\nWell we can try to make it special .\nyeah , that's right .\nSo do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user\nWell\nWell I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television ,   we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter .  Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons . Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh  use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .\nHmm yeah .\nThat's right . Should be a good point .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nNothing  N\nAnd how big should it be ?\nNo . Yeah .\nIt shouldn't be too big ,\nI dunno um\nbut I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .\nYeah .\nWe can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .\nJust big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it .\nYeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMaybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,\nYes\nmaybe more trendy .\nBut you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open .\nFold open ,\nOkay ,\nwhere you can see uh more options . I think\nyeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something ,\nYeah\nAh\nn\nthat's that's\nif you just\nYeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .\nAh right right .\nYeah , or you c\nYeah .\nO or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .\nOh that's good , yeah .\nYeah b I wanted\nYeah .\nWhy should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?\nUh maybe be uh it's it's\nThere are buttons on it .\nNo you can make an uh manual in it .\nYeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .\nOkay . But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .\nBut that's\nUh like a a to have\nYeah , but\nYeah , I think it's much uh  too expensive .\nYeah , maybe it would .\nYeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen .\nAnd we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,\nYeah .\nbecause uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .\nYeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .\nYeah , too fragile .\nYeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh\nNo . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever .\nKid-proof .\nYeah  .\nAnd uh how about the batteries ?\nUm\nUh should you put it in a recharger or a  just\nOh maybe that's a good idea ,\nMa maybe a home station .\njust to put it on your television and just s recharge ,\nYeah .\nyou never have to use any batteries .\nMm yeah .\nMaybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .\nYeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?\nYeah .\nYeah , I dunno .\nWell uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?\nI dunno .\nYeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,\nAh yeah .\nbut I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .\nMaybe have  uh\nUh if you th look at the market , it's probably  it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive .\nYeah , 'cause well\nYeah .\nYeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are  uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,\nYeah , that's right , yeah .\nand now you can put it always at the same place .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMaybe it's  Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive .\nMaybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .\nYeah . You can  yeah , you can buy it with it .\nYeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh\nRechargeable .\nYeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station ,\nYeah .\nor you can change your batteries ,\nOh yeah .\nso .\nThe option , just the option , that's cool .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remote, costs, cost, euros, controls", "dialogue_id": 17}, {"text": "Uh I I set something on paper already ,  size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top ,\nYeah .\nuh it has to lay good in the hand ,\nYeah .\nyou you have to uh\nHas it be  has  does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control\nYeah , I don't I don't know I don't know\nor\nWell I think we have to look at that ,\nif we\n'cause well you can do  the standard way , but then you won't\nYou can make it very special , to create our own um looks ,\nYeah\nbut it's very hard to\nN uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .\nWell you can um have uh  the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .\nNah .\nYeah .\nBut the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .\nYeah .\nSo it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think ,\nYeah .\nso you can do something unique with that .\nAnd what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you  can still uh do the th the functions .\nYeah yeah , what Paul already said .\nYeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .\nYeah .\nUh on on top are the the basic options on top ,\nBut n\nYeah , yeah .\nyeah , but uh i  basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,\nand if you fold it open\nBut maybe it's\nYeah  .\nThat's what I meant .\nso .\nmaybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh  what's it's called ?\nMm .

Here we go . Alright , the agenda for thi oh . Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting  is um  we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group .\nOkay .\nAnd um  So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ?\nUm yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them .\nAlright .\nThank you . Do you want to present it ?\nUm\nYeah , here we are .\nThis is what we came up with . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah . And  we\nOn ?\nMango shape .\nA mango . Okay .\nYeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here\nThe L_E_D_ .\nand this'll be the power point , the on off button kind\nOh . Okay .\nyeah .\nI'm sorry .\nOops .\nWhat was the  where's the L_E_D_ ?\nIt's in the middle of one of the little R_s .\nOh . Okay .\nAnd then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be\nSo it's palm-held .\naccessible from your thumb\nYeah .\nyeah palm-held\nYeah .\nand all the buttons are accessible from your thumb .\nNotice you have a number ten button .\nSo you don't have to  Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ?\nOkay .\nYou just need the nought .\nRight no , that's a zero .\nTake that one off .  Sorry . I was in charge of the numbers .\nNo problem .\nAh .\nAnd this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus .\nSo one plus one would be eleven ,\nYou can go one , three or something .\nor\nOh . You press a plus button ?\nYou press that first and then you go one three yeah .\nOh okay . I've never heard of that kind before .\nWell we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and\nYeah .\nYeah because if you  on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to  um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve .\nYeah .\nOh , there's no e\nOh .\nSo if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two .\nSo the plus and then\nokay .\nyeah .\nI\nOkay .\nBut  Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ?\nNo no , th all  that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine .\nYeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards .\nYeah . Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine .\nYeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?\nSixty .\nYou p Oh . No you press the plus first .\nOh .\nI I  well it doesn't  we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five ,\nbut she says plus   press  which\nWell I don't mind , we can further define that .\nwhat do you think is simpler ?\nI th Um\nIt's a\nI wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .\nYeah .\nYeah it wouldn't be a problem . But I was just wondering\nBut I suppose it's not as snappy .\nYeah .\nlike as long as we realise that's what it'll do .\nWell the there is a  there's a delay on remotes I think .\nOops . Yeah .\nWhere you can have it\nYeah .\nit's like a five second input time .\nYeah . If you don't put it\nSo as long as you hit them dada\nYeah . Yeah ,\nYeah .\nthat  yeah .\nit should be fine .\nYeah .\nAs long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . So\nUm\nWas there  so on the top there is volume and\nAnd channel ,\nA channel .\nwhich is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like\nChannel up volume up . Okay cool .\nC_ and V_ .\nJust so we can flick\nRight , where um where's the power button ?\nYeah .\nIt's in the middle of one of the little R_s .\nIt's the bigger R_ .\nIt's the R_ .\nOh okay .\nSo it's just like  .\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nso it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote .\nWe deci\nYeah .\nYeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers\nMm-hmm .\nbecause we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb .\nOh okay .\nUh e ergonomics are all considered .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nErgonomic , definitely ergonomic .\nAnd  it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well .\nIt could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though .\nOkay .\nBut yeah , no I mean it's a different movement\nso  yeah .\nYeah .\nUm and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness .\nThe spon yeah .\nYeah .\nUm 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this  the  this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it ,\nYeah .\nand it just feels feels different .\nYeah .\nBit of a stress ball feel .\nWould you like to feel it yourselves ?\nYeah .\nYes . I would .\nHow it fits in the palm of your hand ?\nMy goodness .\nThanks .\nThere you go .\nAnd you ?\nGenevieve ?\nYes\nYeah .\n. Oh it's nice . Oh I think I killed the five .\nI did .\nAnd something hmm .\nI killed the four . Oh god .\nO Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype .\nOf Play Doh yeah .\nOh it smells good .\nBut we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination . Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green ,\nOh right .\nor vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in\n'Cause it'd be quite subtle and\nmore settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish .\nYeah . It looks more  Think like vanilla and banana would .\nBanana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company  the yellow and black .\nOkay yeah .\nYeah .\nSo that  for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength .\nI mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the\nKinda Christmas , you know .\nyeah , seasonal .\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nApple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki\nYeah .\nThe pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of ,\nCool .\nand then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated  customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor .\nYeah . Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb .\nYeah .\nUm , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it .\nAlright , thank you very much .\nGood work everyone .\nBravo\nAlright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle .\nMm-hmm .\nSo , I have something I'm going to  Oh wait a minute .\nYou want the\nDo you need to do a presentation first ?\nI don't know what order it goes in .\nYeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second .\nI have one .\nMm go\nWhat time is it anyw\nOh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line .\nEvaluation cri Okay . That's me .\nYeah .\nHello . Oh there we go . Okay . Come on my computer . Come on .  Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties .\nJust press um function eight again .\nShould I press it again ? Last time I did that it sh Okay . You're right .\nAnd then again I think .

Yeah .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "powerpoint, presentation, slides, agenda, presented", "dialogue_id": 18}, {"text": "Okay now I think for this one I could  Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on  right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . Um and looking looking back at my notes from our  both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .  Okay so question number one . Does the remote  whoops . Sorry . Oh I'm not gonna be able  um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once .\nOkay .\nI'll write down our scores up on the\nOoh .\nOkay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ?\nFeel I think .\nMm .\nWe've been quite successful with the rubber coating\nYeah .\nand\nThe look is a little bit more playful .\nWell\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different .\nOh definitely different yeah .\nIt's not your traditional  yeah .\nI think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean  th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nIt's not the kind of  ooh uh at all sleek\nOh you were only given red and black ?\nred , black and yellow , and orange .\nOh okay .\nYeah  so\nUm\nnot very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey .\nYeah .\nSo we want it to be stand out that way , anyway .\nYeah . Okay .\nBut if you can imagine that in like a s just a  maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something\nYeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking .\nWell I know know it's for rubber .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nI mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy .\nPolished . Okay  Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . I kinda  I like the potato look .\nIt's mango .\nOh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg .\nWe we were  we were thinking about\nIt's very different . It's what ?\nIt's mango .\nOh sorry the mango the mango look .\nPotato's fine . Potato's fine .\nyeah .\nYeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood .\nYeah . Totally . It's really adaptable .\nSo I myself would say a one or a two .\nYeah . I would say two . Personally .\nI w I'd say two I think .\nIt's a two ?\nFor the\nOkay ,\nFanciness .\nand p\nYeah .\nfancy\nOne being true . So\nI  uh two , three .\nTwo .\nYeah .\nOkay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was  is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .\nYeah .\nYeah and the use of the rubber .\nUse of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ .\nFor the anti-R_S_I_ .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThe L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative\nIsn't\nand we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons ,\nMm .\nthere's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nIn some aspects it is , like we said .\nYeah . I'd say maybe three .\nI'll go for three as well .\nYeah . And I think  I mean it it's tough to say because we were  we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose .\nYeah we want it simple .\nYeah . Though it was our specification .\nNo . Wouldn't be simple , yeah .\nSo I mean I  we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWe didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ?\nI think so . Yeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah very .\nYeah .\nI think one for that .\nYeah . S Yeah\nYeah . One .\nI think it's\nYeah .\nYeah .\nyou can't really get confused with that .\nNo .\nTh\nI mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number  the plus system .\nThe plus number thing .\nYeah that's the only thing yeah .\nBut once that's figured out , it should be fine .\nYeah and perhaps the turning on but\nNumber four . Is this a good-looking remote ?\nMm .\nRemember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .\nIt's definitely\nAgain I think the colour comes into this .\nYeah colour will definitely be a factor .\nMm-hmm  .\nI think that the logo could be smaller .\nOkay .\nAnd maybe not such a prominent way .\nYeah .\nMaybe like at the bottom , kind of .\nBut the\nNot in\nRemember the management said that it it had to be prominent .\nOh it just had to be on there I guess .\nWhoops .\nYeah .\nShould just not touch it .\nDon't worry .\nThis time it's the three I killed .  I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . Or\nI suppose I've got quite big hands .\nI like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .\nWell\nYeah .\nBut you know what I've just thought of there now . What  where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ?\nMaybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like\nYeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .\nYeah .\nround .\nBut then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand  .\nOh . That's true .\nIt would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think .\nThing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly .\nYeah .\nMaybe , it could  it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up .\nYeah .\nLike that .\nOh that would be nice .\nAh it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying .\nUh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha .\nYeah .\nI g If it's weighted maybe .\n'Kay we're done designing .\nH it's got higher centre of gravity like that .\nDetails , details .\nCome on .\nOkay . So , is this a good-looking remote ?  Would we wanna show it off to our friends ?\nThree . You would though , 'cause it's bit  it's more interesting than other remotes .\nYeah .\nI think , it was another colour and it was like  I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two .\nYeah ?\nI would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that ,\nI mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but\nYeah .\nYeah .\nbut definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours .\nOkay , so should we say two for that ?\nSure .\nYeah .\nYeah ?\nYeah .\nOkay . Uh , question number five . What's um  will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy .\nI think we have to market it in the right way , that um  to say that it is simplistic .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros .\nYeah .\nWe have to market it .\nYeah .\nYeah it  the marketing will have a lot to do with it .\nAnd  the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo ,\nAnd the kinetic energy part . Yeah .\nYeah .  Durable .\nooh no .\nShake it and the buttons fall off .\nBut you know , those'll be firmly on .\nDon't shake   Oh no the plus .  You're\nNo , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for ,\nuse the zero .\nMake a new one .\nBut you're our Marketing Expert .\nbut  I know I am , aren't I ?\nI think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ?\nBut you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money .\nMm , yeah , that's true .\nYeah .\nOh . Exactly . Exactly .\nSo we'll market it that way too .\nYeah . Good point .\nSo yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll\nYeah . I would give it a two still though .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm .\nYeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ?\nDoes this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .\nOr\nMm .\nYeah .\nUm yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics\nYeah .\nI think it does very well .\nOh yeah .\nBecause\nwe said\nyeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing .\nThe zap\nYeah .\nAnd it's just  you won't have to think about it .\nyeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYou don't have to look down to find them .\nThey're clearly there , easy to use .\nYeah .\nSimple .\nUh\nYeah I guess the  I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff .\nYeah .\nBut they're not you and I really .\nMm .\nYeah .\nSo . Okay so one ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly .\nWe have the alarm system .\nNow is there the  is the alarm system still  was it implemented ?\nYeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the  lights  behind the  and it'll vibra\nIt  Yeah\nl lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm .\nIt'll be again in the marketing .\nI thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .\nYeah . The light  it will .\nOr or was it gonna make a noise ?\nYeah . But when the alarm's not\nBut\nyeah . If you\nBut both\nYou press the button it makes a noise right ?\nIt turns into a duck and starts quacking .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYou could s\nYeah . Awesome . Awesome .\nYeah .\nOh , that would be brilliant .\nHere I am .\nI'd be tempted to\nWell the thing is , if it was  had an alarm system ,\nUm\nI mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point .\nYeah .\nSo you can't see the alarm , but it would light up .\nIt would have to be in the market\nI though w it was gonna make a noise .\nOkay .\nYeah . Alarm ,\nYeah but you still couldn't see it .\nbut you can't see an alarm inside uh  the alarm system itself .\nIt would just be a little speaker on the back or something .\nOkay .\nWe  oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype .\nYeah . Yeah . It w yeah .\nBut yeah , it'll be there .\nOh okay .\nSo we can  we could say that\nWhoo . Okay .\nSorry .\nWe can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find .\nYeah , totally .\nYeah .\nOkay . Um\nSorry Heather .\nNo problem , mm .\nThat wasn't very clear .\nQuestion number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult .\nTotally .\nSo it has to be  yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do .\nSo the plu the plus  w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple ,\nThe plus thing needs to be worked on .\nYeah .\nYeah\nwon't it ?\nI think\nYeah .\njust because it's  we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use .\nWell\nYeah .\nDo  Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an  just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .\nYeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter .\nThat kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press\nMm .\nYeah but you don't have to press zeros .\nI don't know why .\nYou could just press six enter ,\nOh okay . Right .\nAnd then like twelve , enter .\nAnd  or sixty six enter , y\nor one two enter .\nAlright , aye .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good\nYeah .\nUm , okay so we can\nI'd say w yeah one .\nwe'll say yes it's uh one ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOoh . Mm .\nQuestion number nine .\nOh .\nUh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ?\nInjury .\nYeah .\nUm , which affected over a quarter of users .\nHmm .\nS\nI think so . It's like right in the\nBut if you're zapping\nYour thumb might get a little bit uh\nYeah , that's what I was thinking .\nyeah . I don't think it will f\nWe may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about .\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nthe biology .\nBut it is soft .\nMm-hmm .\nIt's soft ,\nAnd that's kind of what the um\nand\nMm .\nMm .\nthe PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ ,\nAnd people could\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nso  maybe it is but\nI don't know what other options there are .\nI think we're getting\nYeah .\nthat's true .\nCould  I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger .\nMm .\nBut there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control .\nYeah .\nSo , one or two do you think ?\nI think\nI I'd say t\nyeah , I think too .\ntwo . Yeah\nYeah .\nTwo okay . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ?\nYes we did .\nYeah .\nNow is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ?\nN We we can't really do that\nIs the yellow\nbecause for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow .\nIt won't stand out .\nMm-hmm .\nSo n it's not always gonna be the same colour .\nIt sounds like the colour's something that we\nWell , yeah the colours are yellow and grey .\nYeah .\nGray , yeah .\nSo it could be grey on the banana one .\nYeah , could be grey .\nYeah .\nBut I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though ,\nYeah that's right ,\ndepending on the\nwe didn't even rea\nSo I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ .\nMm . Yeah . I think this is the\nYeah .\nthe factor that we've been least successful in confronting .\nOkay .\nPerhaps a metallic\nMm , yeah .\nor or  like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ?\nYeah .\nThat isn't rubber .\nAnd the buttons in the middle .\nYeah .\nOkay So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ?\nFour I think . Well I don't\nFour ?\nwhat do  what\nHum .\nWell we have good reasons for it , so we  but we can still put a a four ?\nOkay .\nOkay .\nOkay , and final question .  Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ?\nCurrent trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess .\nI would say so .\nFollowing that briefing we did .\nBut maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWith the with the colours .\nYeah .\nLike um the colour scheme names and stuff .\nYeah .\nNo , uh , are the plates interchangeable ?\nYeah .\nI think I missed a few\nYeah .\nYeah .\nthey are ? So you can have banana and kiwi and\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nokay . Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more\nThat's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates .\nMm-hmm .\nIt is .\nI think w yeah , I think one . Well that was our brief and we followed the brief .\nThe thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango .\nWell we haven't got a big banana but  Oh yeah .\nBe like\nNo .  No .\nYeah .\nMaybe if it was scented .\nOh that would be class .\nOh yeah . There we go . That would be great .\nYeah we have money for that . Um\nAlright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?\nUm\nYes we do . So I  wh what was I gonna put for that ?\nOh .\nA two for fashion ?\nI would say two .\nYeah . Two .\nOkay .\nOkay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven\nOne point nine or something ?\nIt's\nIt's\nis\nYeah .\nI don't know these things . Um , between one and two .\nBetween one and two .\nBetween  okay .\nSo that's pretty fantastic .\nClose to two .\nUm .\nYeah .\nYeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one .\nAlright .\nI got\nDoes that seem right then ?\nYeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down .\nMm .\nOkay .\nUh , aye .\nIt seems like it should be more around two .\nYeah .\nYeah . Uh , should've added five .\nDo we have an online calculator ?\nI'm attempting to do that  right now .\nThis is  .\nOkay .\nYeah it is one point nine . Ooh .\nOh wow .

And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be  you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So\nUh . Just one thing . Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon ,\nso maybe you could hurry up a bit\nsorry ?\nIt's true . I have another meeting so if you could uh\nYou have another meeting soon ?\nYeah .\nSo you have to be quick .\nYeah , for the lawnmower project .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nSo the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .\nSo uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil .

So  Here the uh financial objective of our project . That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros .\nI is there a matter for a new remote control ?\nYeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs .\nIs it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ?\nWe have to discuss that point .\nAh\nOn\nthis is not defined at all ?\nyeah you you can suggest points like this . So what what\nAh , okay .\nso we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . So what's  what are your ideas about that ?\nMaybe I can have the  your opinion from the marketing side ?\nWell uh do we sell other stuff ? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us .\nOkay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device .\nYeah .\nDo you agree ?\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . So maybe it should be for multiple devices .

Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well .\nYeah .\nThat might be good uh track to follow .\nLike as an optional thing .\nOptional or selled with it ?\nAnd I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control .\nYeah .\nWe should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping .\nMaybe we can have uh  But we don't design the T_V_ .\nMaybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .\nAh yeah .\nBarks .\nYeah .\nYeah , barks , yeah .\nBarks .\nSo we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ?\nYeah . Yeah whistle .\nI don't know , whistle-able ?  Th\nWhistle tracking .\nWhistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control .

Who would like to go first ?\nJust trying to move mine right now .\nOkay . Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ?\nYeah  .\nOkay . Trend watching ? 'Kay .\nYeah . Okay , so trend watching . Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . So what they want . Right now customers want fancy versus functional . Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they  like of the product that they want , describing like the  in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . So the customer basically is confused . They don't know exactly what they want . They want us to tell them .\nThey want everything , but simply .\nYes . Exactly .\nOkay .\nSo we can go to next .\nMm 'kay .\nOkay . So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns .\nSo I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to\nMm . Mm .\nrather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . I mean do you guys know what I mean .\nRight . Yes .\nYeah th\nYeah . Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend ,\nRight .\nand our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months ,\nRight . People don't buy a new remote every so often .\nI I can\nbecause  Yeah . I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now .\nI can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation .\nOkay . Awesome .\nOkay .\nUm so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product .\nAnd I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . Actually right here . So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool . So it's classically retro .\nHmm .\nSo I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it .\nVery good . I like it .

And that's it .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentations, presentation, remote, design, designs", "dialogue_id": 20}, {"text": "Op mm 'kay .\nOkay .\nGreat . Great presentation . Ready ?\nOkay hang on .\n'Kay .\nSee if it's there .\nWhich one is it ?\nI don't know . Hang on .\nInterface concepts , no ?\nInterface concepts new .\nEither refresh it , or it sh\nY\nOh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . Hang on .\n'Kay .\nMine will always read copy of something or other .\nSorry ?\nI I copied mine before I sent it over .\nOh okay .\nSorry , hang on . Don't know  .\nOh there we go .\nOkay .\nOkay , um  looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . Uh if you wanna start the next slide .\nSure .\nUm uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . And then also there's the idea of the base . That's sort of like an idea there . And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . It's becoming really  and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both  kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like  using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but  Anyway , next .\nMm 'kay .\nUm there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow .\nMm .\nAnd so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . Um but then you have  you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way .\nMm .\nEither that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel .\nOkay .\nOkay . Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . Um this is particularly geared towards children .\nThat's cute .\nUm it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain   channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , you know , the C_ Beebies or something like that ,\nuh keep them away from other channels . So that's like another ar Um ,\nOkay .\nI mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . You have the wider section for the main controls there . Uh you could see how many buttons there are . And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_  function which we are not gonna be using . Um . So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction .\n'Kay .\nAnd then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way .\nHmm .\nYeah .\nNo .\nBut it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this .\nMm . Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever .\nRight .\nI have four of those remotes .\nGood lord .\nOkay . Ready ? Oh , yeah .

Th that looks like it . 'Kay . So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . So that being said  Next slide , please . Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . Next slide , please . Thank you . Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it .  Next slide , please . Um just talking to the um manufacturing division . They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that .\nHmm .\nSo next slide , please .\nInteresting .\nSuggested casing options . Okay . We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood .\nI don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters\nThat would be amazing , though , yeah .\nYeah .\nNo , splinters would\nUm certain restrictions do apply here though . Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . Double-curved , you can't do titanium .\nWhat is that ?\nUm that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you  the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold .\nMm .\nMm .\nNow if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . And uh so you  functions what  for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .\nRight .\n'Kay .\nI think I have one more slide .\nNo , okay .\nNo , I didn't . Um the manufacturing division also has said that um  they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . So depends on what we decide we wanna do . In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes .\nMm .\nRight .\nHmm .\nOkay .\nOkay .

Let's go back to um  Now we have to make some decisions . Where were we ?\nLet me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before ,\nSure .\nand that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . Um .\nOh this  the thing we were talking about earlier .\nRight except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for  So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill ,\nbut I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme  do we program the responses and the questions . So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised ,\nMm .\nor can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this .\nRight . Right .\nYeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options .\nRight ,\nSo that way the remote reads it .\nso it's got like a limited memory and  programme it . So it's sort of iffy ,\nMm .\nbut that's kind of what you'd say .\nI feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really\nHmm . Programme .\nI mean we could do it , but\nIf it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology\nWell , we are making the chip .\nTechnology .\nHmm .\nSo , I mean  But , I guess , we have to look at w what  our production cost is for the chip itself anyway .\nAnd it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like\nMm .\nYeah .\nthe , I mean just like the more advanced it is ,\nYeah .\nthe better it'll sell .\nI I thought  offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know  I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe .\nHmm .\nSo that we could reduce cost .\nYeah , 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy .\nYeah .\nOkay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um .\nOkay .\nDo we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ?\nOh the base , yeah .\nThe base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ?\nI think the p\nI always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like , before\nHmm .\n'Cause if it's something really really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up\nYeah , and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ .\nW\nIt's not gonna be a huge universal remote .\nRight .\nWe need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want\nWhat size battery and\nWell , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this ,\nand exactly  It could be like this . Yes .\n'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons .\nI'd , well uh  This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever ,\nAre you gonna lose it easier ?\nbecause  But if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that .\nThat's true .\nSo we can make it small if we have a l locating device .\nYeah .\nIf we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . So\nSo i That's the other thing ,\nHmm .\nit's like  You know  Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size  period ?\nTwo double A_s , for this size .\nBut like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be  have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size .\nRight .\nHonestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact\nRight . I agree , it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just\nYeah .\nSo we sh\nSmaller , without\nA battery like this guy .\nYeah .\nMm yeah .\nYeah .\nAlright , so what direction do you want to go in ? You wanna vote ?\nI think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced .\nI'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of\nYeah .\nI'm a away from the base .\nbigger and the base .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThat just seems so clunky and\n'Kay so\nYeah , because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is ,\nSmaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nOkay .\nyeah\nThe only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash .\nYou're kidding .\nOh .\nYou know it happens .\nHmm .\nI've had three watches go that way too .\nYeah .\nOh watches I've  but I've never washed a cell phone .\nOuch .

'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium ,\nYeah . That'll  Yeah , exactly .\nMm .\nmake them a rarity so to speak .\nThe selling point , yeah .\nWe could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if\nYeah .\nAre we restricted by this ?\nI I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm\nWell the original\nTwenty five Euros\nnot sure that we'll have the time and money to  produce a whole array of\nOkay .\nremotes .

And buy the extra case .\nif they wanted .\nOkay .\nI think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options .\nSo we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could  give two latex covers to start .\nYeah .\nThe  what the top face , right ?\nYeah .\nOkay . Okay .\nYeah , because the soft latex definitely is squishy . That's in . Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic .\nRight . Right .

I mean if\nYeah , it could be whatever ,\nYeah .\nas long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle .\nYeah . Mm-hmm .\nWell , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are ,\nMm .\nOh , that's true .\nbecause w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?\nGood point .\nIn the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side ,\nYeah .\nwhich I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side ,\nYeah .\nOh , I see what you mean .\nthat could be particularly useful .\nI think so .\nSo scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ?\nYeah , I like that . 'Kay .\nBut we definitely  If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled .\nMm .\nYeah ,\nWell , if it's just up and down\nlike on the side of it . Oh if it's just up and down .\nBut is that for\nVolume or channel .\nWhich ?\nI don't know .\nWell , you could do some on both sides .\nDo we have both sides ?\nCan we ?\nMm yeah . We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then ,\nSo that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan\nYeah .\n'cause oth  otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know .\nThat's squishy . That's squishy .\nWell , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .\nhave buttons .\nMm . Yeah .\nOkay .\nYeah ,  that .\nHmm . 'Kay any other ideas ?\nUm what colour ?\nOh , yeah . Latex covers . W\nWe have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available .\nWell I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . And that's at the bottom of it .\nYeah .\nI think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers ,\nWhich button ?\nI don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some  the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? Every cover ?\nYeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky .\nYeah .\nSo I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea .\nIf we want it to be visible and  Um are all those  those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? But those are plastic , right ?\nYeah .\nThey're not titanium .\nYeah .\nI kind of like that look . Uh but , or if it was really\nFor our base one ?\nYeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool .\nYeah ,\nWhat are your thoughts ?\nor like a gun-metal grey ,\nGun-metal gray .\n'cause then it combines the silver and the black .\nThere you go , gun-metal gray .\nI'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button .\nWhy ?\nIt'll wear off .\nWhat's the button\nYeah , buttons wear off .\nMm .\nWell , w w then what's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ? I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing .\nRight .\nHmm .\nThere's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual\nOn the back ?\nBut you don't\nBut we want it to be seen .\nIt d visible\nBut uh , yeah , you don't see it .\nVisibility though\nWe need it to be seen .\n'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery .\nWell , hang on . The other option is  , I don't know if you can see it but it's like if\nI can find it again .\nYeah , it's like the second to last slide .\nOkay . And yours was called Interface Concept ?\nInterface , yeah .\nThis one ?\nYeah . Um .\nWell , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly .\nOkay , it's the very right one . You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top .\nMm\nAnd so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in .\nOkay , yes\nIf c you envisioning it ?\nyes .\nAnd so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes .\nOkay .\nThe only problem is we're using a latex overlay so  it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons ,\nHmm .\nso I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be .\nYeah . Yeah , yeah .\nLike a little cut-out kind of\nYeah .\nRight .\nOkay .\nThat's like , you know ,  a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened .\nRight .\nAnd so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ?\nYeah .\nAnybody see anything that they liked in these ones ?\nSome of tho Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based .\nMm .\nUm well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based .\nMm .\nWell , kind of . Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow .\nYellow .\nYellow , I like that idea .\nYeah .\nLike if we  like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better .\nMm .\nUm where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow .\nMm .\nSo we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons .\nOh , that one .\nI like the yellow illumination idea , very good .\nYeah .\nOkay .

Okay , um I have to go  again .\nit going ?\nHopefully that should be it this time . Okay , I think we're there . That's good . Okay , um  Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . Um  of the of the remote control . Um I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary .\nOkay .\nWe then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's obviously found in the television .  . Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , so . I'll just go through there . S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? Oh I'll j\nUh there's the rubber on the right , I think .\nI think it's that little\nOh I see . Oh okay . I'll get rid of the bear.$\nit's magic .\nOkay that's great . Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no , a power supply which we'd probably get  it's probably gonna be the battery . Um we then have a particular button , which may be   that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . Um but this is how the basic system works . Um that sends  after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which um then sends  It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender .  Um . So that's  . That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . So this is the uh user interface . Um this is the chip itself , which then  , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . And the sender sends a message to the receiver . 'Kay .\nSo the the top bit's the power source , yes ?  .\nAh yes , that's the power source . Um .  going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . Um and then the sender ,\nand infra-red um has been used quite successfully . If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . You don't have to be point directly at the television itself .\nSo the battery is the  in the sender .\nUm  Yes .

Thank you . Mine's not quite as complicated as all that .\nThat's what we like to hear .\nDid I press function ? Yeah .\nIs it control function ei Oh , th there you go .\nOh . Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know .  Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . Um here are two example remotes . Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . Um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . So ,  it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . Um they're nice , kinda clearly labelled . Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . So it's very very user friendly , and it's got a little splash of colour . Could maybe do with some more colour . Um .\nWell there's a couple of things there . Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product .\nHmm . Do we get to see that ?\nI haven't as yet , no .\nWill you be presenting that in a bit ?\nBut uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . So uh I'm guessing that uh uh I notice on the bottom there it's got uh what's that ? A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red .\nHmm .\nWould you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . Possibly ?\nWhat do you mean by the circular section ?\nJ yeah yeah yeah j yeah\nLike all of that bottom bit ?\njust this little bit is that  I think that's still um a video remote part ,\nYeah .\nso maybe we could get rid of that as well .\nYeah . And I don't really think that you need nine numbers .\nWell b uh w\nI mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .\nWell th the on the\nLike how often do you hit nine ?\nWell uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time ,\nMm-hmm .\nand we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . But but\nIt's just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn't have them then they might think it's\nBut , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh I mean  how many channels do we have to um  actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? I would have thought that uh  it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got  although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six\nand uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others .\nMm-hmm .\nHmm .\nSo I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather\nHmm .\nOkay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take a second\n'cause you have to be able to stop it . Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted .\nUm some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting  rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty\nHmm .\nand then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want\nMm-hmm .\nand that would cut down your time .\nMm . Um .\nAnyway .\nBut I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels .\nOkay , yeah .\nLike to get to fifty five and the higher numbers\nWhatever .\nYeah .\nOkay . Okay . Limit the number of buttons , user friendly .\nBut I suppose nine's not really excessive .\nI suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you  uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number .\nI suppose it does make a good pattern .\nSo with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with\nYeah Well that's true , yeah ,\nYeah .\nyou could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense .\nYeah . 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need .\nYeah .\nUm .\nDoes .\nMm-hmm .\nSo w so what was the circular thing that you were\nOkay . Um I think that's just for a video , so we wouldn't need any of that at all .\nSo we could get it down to what ?\nIf it's just for T_V_ , which is what it is at the moment .\nMm-hmm .\nSo we get to  How many buttons have we got ? We've just got ten , eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . I guess .\nMm-hmm .\nUm which isn't really too many . That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .\nMm-hmm . Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market  was one of the considerations .\n'Kay .\nI'm  I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing ,\nMm-hmm .\nor was I meant to give you that information ?\nUm I'm not sure . I had I've had some market information ,\nRight .\nbut not from the company , no .\nRight , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery .\n'Kay .\nWe've only got about another four hours left .\nOkay , so is everyone happy with that ?\nAh yes yes , that seems good .\nOkay .\nRight well that's the end of my presentation .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "channel, remotes, remote, channels, buttons", "dialogue_id": 21}, {"text": "'Kay . I'm gonna pull this off .\nI think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up .\nYeah , I think she said twenty seconds to um\nUh-huh .\nI'm sure we'll have by the end of today .\nOkay .  I'll give it another go . Yeah , there we go .\nRight , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and um how do people use it ? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age  forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it .  Okay , so  My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some  sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech  A design which looks high-tech , basically . Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . That's worth thinking about . Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . That that might be the market that we're we're looking for . And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to  speech recognition to change the channels . 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .\nMm .\nOkay um , and that's the end of the slide show . That's it . Cool .\nWhat was that last wee bit there ?\nDo  a lot of um\nUm about speech recognition ?\nSpeech recognition ,\nYeah .\nBut that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't .\nYoun young people pref Yeah , they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so .\nNo what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um .\nWell that's right .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nAnd possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have  You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can   some kind of buzzer system between the two . So you can press a button which is always kept in one place\nYeah .\nand then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .\nUh-huh . Yeah . Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well ,\nThat is true , yes .\nwhich which again would probably be a bit expensive , but\nHmm .\nThere's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I can't remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that .\nYeah .\nSounds reasonable .\nThat'd probably be really simple ,\nYeah .\nthey're cheap .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . So\nSo I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the  or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote .\nWell if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . But if you  I know . Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever .  You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if\nYeah . Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nYeah . Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be .\nYeah .\nBut you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then\nyou could have an option to turn it off . Or\nMm-hmm .\nPerhaps , um .\nYeah .\nSo that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .\nMm .\nSo uh  Any sugges Well , any conclusions ?\nUm would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?\nWell if it does then we can't .\nMm .\nConsidering\nIt's that simple ,\nYeah .\nbecause we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had  The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . We've got um the remote was only for the television and not for  because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . So that means that uh\n'Kay .\nOkay .\nso these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project .\nMm-hmm .\nSo we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .\nYes .\nSo anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick\nHas to be simple enough to\nbecause time to market is is critical . S\nI suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . Um .\nMm-hmm .\nIt would . But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .\n'Kay .\nAdded extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours .\nMm-hmm .\nSo  and if  and we've gotta get to the end . Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nSo", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "remotes, controls, remote, buttons, control", "dialogue_id": 21}, {"text": "Right okay , uh so I need to  Right . So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time . But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions\nAbout five minutes .\nand how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .\nYes .\nMm-hmm .\nWe'll also know w when the next meeting is\nUm .\nI um  so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . Does that make reasonable sense ?\nMm-hmm .\nYes that seems right .\nYeah .\nOkay , yeah .\nSo we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nDo it via the email\nOkay . Yep .\nso that rather than coming you know  If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate .\nOkay .\nBut if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh  on what they come up with  effectively at the next meeting .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nRight , is there\nSo do we need to decide on the functions now ? S\nI would guess so .\nWell I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function .\nMm-hmm .\n'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it .\nYeah and  Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so .\nYep .\nI don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so .\nYeah . I don't really know about the voice recognition thing .\nI  w well uh i\nMaybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment ,\nSomething simple . Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short ,\nand if something comes back\nyou want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nsomething that's quick and simple . So ,\nYeah .\nsounds good .\nAnd that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology .\nWell , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be\nMm-hmm .\nOn the basis that if we've got  if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do ,\nnow something that doesn't like whis uh\nNo not everyone can whistle , can they , though ?\nWell I I I don't know . Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option ,\nbut if  I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle ,\nNo ,\nI'd go more\nclapping , I think clapping ,\nYeah , f more for clap .\nyeah . Yeah .\nso uh so clap option .\nYeah .\nOkay .\n'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ?\nUh . Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying ,\nIs that one of the\nthat uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext ,\nHmm .\nso so take out teletext .\nTaking out teletext , okay .\nDid we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers\nRight .\nand then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .\nYeah , I think so , so zero to nine .\nMm . I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number ,\nYeah .\nso you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together .\nOkay , ten numbers\nand then some kind of device to allow uh\nYeah .\nI'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers .\nYeah .\nOr multiple digits .\nYeah .\nDid we decide anything about um the other functions ? As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? You had an had an idea about the menu ?\nUh  we could possibly put an L_  a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that\nBut just thinking um people probably  I mean you don't have  you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once .\nYeah .\nSo and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . You can't really avoid that .\nMm-hmm .\nNo .\nExcept the new digital markets which do it by themselves .\nHmm .\nBut the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic\nSo that'll be in\nYeah .\nYes .\nand if it is at the moment , that's fine . But at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it  uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances\nYeah . Yeah .\nand the idea is to have an international market\nYeah yeah .\nMm .\nwhich is\nYeah .\nAnd it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech .\nYeah . I s I suppose um if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote\nPossibly .\n'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so .\nThat's right .\nI mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in .\nYeah . So how would this menu function work ?\nYeah .\nWould you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .\nYeah ,\nYeah ,\nlike the volume or something .\nthat would be a good idea , yeah .\nOkay .\nYeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . My dad was watching a film the other week\nMm-hmm .\nand it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up .\nwe're gonna have the the individual numbers\nHmm .\nand then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide  Presu uh I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu  use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work .\nUh  I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one  the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one .\nRight , okay um .\nSo maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you're basically pressing\nthat also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so .\nRight .\nOkay , well .\nWell , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ?\nOkay .\nMm .\nYeah .\nSo y Ah That's a very good idea .\nSo you don't use it that much , you don't have to see it all the time . But it's all there if you need it .\nThat is that is a good idea actually .\nYeah , yeah .\nSor sort of a second .\nSo you keep um\nLike a hidden panel .\nRight we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told . I don't know if you've got the same .\nOkay . Uh not quite , but I guess  .\nOkay . So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back .\nKeep the other buttons but hide them away .\nHmm . And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu ,\nAh .\nbut he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nSo\nYeah .\nSo um  we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess .\nYeah .\nThat's right .\nYeah .\ndata functions hidden at back . Can bring out when needed .\nSo th the  The detailed ones would be sort of brightness ,\nYeah .\nuh sorta\nThat's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . We have to decide .\nSo sh Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then\nMm-hmm .\nI guess so .\nYeah .\nSo on the\nSo on front ,\nabout the number  .\nnumbers ,\nUm the volume up and down .\nAnd the volume ?\nvolume .\nShall we have a mute button as well ?\nUm .\nSorry ?\nA mute button as well .\nYeah .\nMm .\nYeah . Or\nYeah I think they're handy .\nMm-hmm . And probably a power one as well .  Dunno .\nI know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity  . Have you seen the adverts ? Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nIf you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time .\nYeah .\nLike we should maybe try to discourage people from standby .\nBut then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change .\nYeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here .\nYeah .\nSo so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ?\nYeah .\nWe can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by .\nUh-oh danger sign .\nI think you probably should .\nYeah , but a little bit smaller .\nOkay .\nCompromise .\nWell   .\nUm are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ?\nUm 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so .\nOkay , so we'll have um\nRight .\nSo we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ?\nChannel up and down .\nUm .\nWhat else have we got ? What was that , sixteen ?\nNumbers is ten , volume is twelve ,\nVolume button . How many volumes ?\nth Yeah si One up , one down .\nRight okay .\nOn mute .\nAnd a mute , yeah . That's sixteen isn't it , yeah .\nIs there anything else ? Um .\nI don't think so , no .\nPower button , stand-by , channel , up and down . So is that it ?\nso .\nOkay . That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . And then at the back ?\nYou've got brightness and contrast .\nMaybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be .\nAnd then\nOkay . So on the back it'll have brightness , contrast ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nanything else ? You're also gonna have the channel tuner  , as it were .\nUh there's audio functions .\nSo tuner up and down , I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nTuner , would that have up and down ?  .\nUm up  Tune one way , tune the o\nI think they normally do .\nokay  . Okay .\nI I dunno I dunno possibly .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah .\nOh yeah and th and a enter button just to select . Yeah , okay . Um I guess we're keeping s it simple . We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up , volume down .\nUm up volume , yeah , I would have thought so .\nUm .\nYeah .\nSo I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things .\nOkay .\nDo they have their own  do they have their own controls on their actual products , then ,\nYeah .\nUm maybe for the younger market .\nor do you have to do it via the remote ?\nUm I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel .\nYeah I suppose if we've got their  if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .\nYeah . Yeah .\nOh no , I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote .\nOh , okay . Right .\nBut I don't really know what they're for ,\nMm-hmm .\nI've never used them .\nUm .\nI just know they're something to do with Dolby .\nMaybe unless something comes up then we should I think\nWell you might get some research .", "topic_id": 4, "keywords": "planning, remotes, meeting, remote, minutes", "dialogue_id": 21}, {"text": "Well shall we look into that and just get back together .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nRight so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting .\nRight .\nRight .\nAnd we'll meet back at I'm not sure .

But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .\nYeah .\nSo we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .\nWell , that's interesting .\nIt's quite interesting .\nYou could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .\nYeah , o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh  telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone .\nYes .\nYeah , yeah .\nIt's the it's the rubber uh cover .\nYeah , it is , it is i yeah .\nAnd it's uh colourful .\nYeah .\nIt looks likes a banana .  We have the fruit , we have the colours .  We have the simple design .\nDo you know the phone ?\nI don't know the phone ,\nIt's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five ,\nbut I can imagine it .\nI believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away ,\nUm thirty five .\nOh , that one , yes .\nthe very\nAnd the b the light blue and  it's also in yellow .\nNow I kn uh  oh , I know , I know . Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .\nYou kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th\nI've seen it ,\nOkay . Okay . Um uh\nbut\nokay . Do you have   uh thit  that was\n'Kay . Uh that's about it .\nOkay .  Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the  our target group .\nYes .\nAnd um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .\nUh soft material .\nOkay .\nSo  So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?\nUh the fancy look and feel .\nOkay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .\nYes . Apparently .\nOkay , Roo ,\nYeah .\ncould you do your presentation ?\nMm-hmm . Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um\nOkay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .\nUh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and  just um , well , a weird um shape .\nShape .\nSo I suggest  I couldn't uh  I had a small uh mock-up uh  sign on the  on  paper .\nBut it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple  f uh a shape on uh  in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .\nMm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um  I mean this is how you hold a remote control .\nYes .\nUm it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,\nSlippery .\ns because um\nBut if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .\nYou have to grab it .\nYeah . Yeah , exactly .\nSo it's easy in your hand  Uh indeed .\nYeah .\nYes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,\nYeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .\nYeah .\nso you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier .\nYeah . It grips automatically . Yeah ,\nSo m Yes .\nokay .\nBut I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .\nOkay , good .\nGreat .\nOh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .\nYeah . Way too much I think for our goal ,\nYeah .\nyeah .\nSo if you have the voice recognition , you can  you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .\nOkay , b but I think we'll\nOkay , but I'll I'll go into that ,\nyeah .\nbecause there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a  it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing .  We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .\nOkay .\nUh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that .\nYeah . Right .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "colours, colourful, colouring, themes, blue", "dialogue_id": 22}, {"text": "But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source  source . Which brings me to the different energy sources .  Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh  remote controls .\nYou really have to imagine like  winding up your  uh\nGreat .\nWell , it would be very new to the market ,\nI d\nbut\nIt would be very new ,\nbut it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think .\nYeah .\nUh   Well ,\nthis is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're  you you have to um make some kind of energy  kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .\nLike the watch .\nIt have  it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .\nI think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .\nMm-hmm . It's very funny indeed .\nI mean solar is  of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel .\nMm-hmm . Indeed .\nUm hand dynamo\nBut if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and\nWell , maybe m\nif uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also .\nYeah , I know .\nMm-hmm . Yes .\nYou you walk\nYeah .\nand uh  but uh you  you're sitting on a couch .\nBut you know you know from your own watch  your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy .  the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a  in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something ,\nYeah . And wha\nwell , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .\nOkay .\nSo , but maybe  maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries\nYeah .\nand um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .\nOkay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .\nUh yes , it does .\nYeah .\nI'll come to that later .\nOkay .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "solar, rubber, dynamos, casings, titanium", "dialogue_id": 22}, {"text": "And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .  The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um  uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently\nMm-hmm .\nuh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four\nMm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .\nYes . That is possible too . Yes .\nBut I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels  I had some  I had some information about it too .\nMm-hmm .\nI don't think  there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .\nWell\nI d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .\nWell , mayb uh well , m me neither .

Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .\nAnd click it to muten the device .\nWell , okay . It's quite goods .\nAnd and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .\nMm-hmm . Yes .\nSo maybe um  I guess that  that's something you two uh need to think about .\nYeah .\nUh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .\nUm   Uh well ,\nWheel .\nit's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .\nOkay .\nHmm .  But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this .\nYeah .\nAnd  Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now .\nWell , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .\nSo maybe it's not no  .\nNokia has a  well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .\nHmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .\nYeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .\nIt doesn't use a   . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here .\nFor you too , yeah .\nYeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .\nWi within reach . Yes , you have to .\nSo in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .\nYes .  yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay .\nOkay . Sebastian . Um\nOkay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .\nYeah .\nThere's  there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation .  About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .\nYeah yeah , you can um  I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word  you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .\nMm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So  so\nUm you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function\nokay .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nand uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that's the sample sensor . So So if you say mute , it says mute again ,\nOkay .\nand then it's um  well , I believe it's uh\nMm-hmm .\nIt performs the action . Yeah .\nYeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what  which he believes it is .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nSo you say mute , he repeats mute and you  makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .\nOkay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .\nOkay . Uh well  uh\nOkay .\nd did we already decide on the display ? To\nUm no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about .\nYeah . Well , I don't have um  I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information  uh y I don't think you need it on a display .\nNo .\nEspecially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh\nI I don't think either .\n'cause uh  uh all  any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,\nNo .

Okay , well\nth", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "buttons, mouse, controls, scroll, remote", "dialogue_id": 22}, {"text": "my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the  a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper .\nOkay . Good .\nSo I don't think we should use the dynamo thing .\nKineti okay .\nThe kinetic thing it  it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm  I think you should combine it with batteries .\nOkay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,\nOtherwise it will not  too advanced ,\ntoo\nuh well .\nyeah .\nIt's  in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .\nYeah , but that  that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .\nBut  Yes . And I think it's more robust .\nYeah . Okay .\nIt's more uh Uh it's more functional .\nBut what about um the markets  uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium\nNo no , but the uh um  that's what Sebastian said .\nThe titanium thing uh we have to skip it .\nHe said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different .\nOkay . Oh ,\nSo um\nsorry . Yeah .\nSo I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,\nYeah .\nand we should uh use wood or something like that .\nNo ,\nAnd I would think\nAnd\nr\nyeah ,\nrubber with colours .\nthe  yeah , the older people liked wood .\nOh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .\nNo the\nColourful and\nOkay .\nYeah , the younger people liked soft material .\nYeah .\nOkay , spongy materials .\nYeah .\nOkay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy .\nAnd they can be implemented with a regular chip ?\nSo  Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple\nOkay , but we also  uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker\nWell , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh  a different\noh ,\nBut but do we want the curved uh uh design ,\nevalu\nor\nI think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .\nI it's too dull . Yeah .\nI don't think c our customers will like it .\nYeah .\nAnd um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot  um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .\nYeah . Okay . Okay .\nSo I think this is the best of two worlds .\nOkay , what about um  the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour\nYes . It's it's  uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .\nYeah .\nIt's very unlogical .\nBut most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .\nWell\nWell the there has to be some pointing at . But\nIt depends also on your on your\nWell , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just  to the other wall .\nWell , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably  you're probably right .\nYeah .\nBut if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um  yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .\nAll lights get absorbed , yeah .\nSo\nYes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light .\nYeah .\nSo  it has an  it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .\nAnd the regular chip .\nI think uh it gives us the advantage of\nAnd and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .\nYes , yes .\nI like the scroll wheels uh idea .\nAnd uh skip  and skip the L_C_D_ part .\nYeah .\nI don't think it it's any uh value added thing .\nNo . Think so too .\nSo\nWell , it looks  uh yeah , well um\nOkay .\naccording to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,\nTechnology .\nand I mean L_C_D_ is\nYes . It's not very flashy and new .\nwell , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard\nStandard ?\nthan than  Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem .\nMm-hmm .\nBecause if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,\nMm-hmm .\nbecause it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .\nYes .\nBut we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .\nMm yeah .\nUh I think our customers will go insane .\nOkay , okay .\nIt's it's too much .\nYeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or\nNah , um n no , I don't think so . M\nNo ? Sebast uh nee , Roo ?  Roo , do you have any other\nUm no . Nothing more .\nNothing more . Um\nOkay . Uh the n the next phase will be um the um  not the\nSebas\nwhat is the next phase  f Flores ?\nWell , we we  need to describe uh decisions now .\nOkay .\nSo um\nSo i\non the energy , well , we decided .\nOkay .\nChip .\nOkay .\nThe case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve .\nOkay , okay .\nUser interface um\nUh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yeah , okay .\nYes , they can work .\nSorry , yeah .\nThey cannot work with double-curved .\nOh , sorry . Yeah .\nThat's that's problem . I'll check it for you .\nUm then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .\nYeah .\nKeep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design .\nYes . Mm-hmm .\nAnd for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .\nUm and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .\nOkay .\nAnd I'm going uh to plan my holidays .\nOkay .\nThe project drawing is for the next\nSo you will be on the Bahamas . Uh\nYeah , it's it's uh  when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .\nYeah , right .\nOkay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?\nYeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down .\nI'll do .\nGreat . Um  Uh you you need to help me . Um\nOkay . W start with the casing .\nThe casing is curved , single-curved .\nSingle-curved .\nOkay , single-curved case . Okay . What about the energy source ?\nTraditional batteries uh and solar .\nBut can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ?\nNo ,\n'Cause if we have to choose\nthey can be complementary . Uh al al I uh\nyeah ?\nI I think they can . Yes .\nOkay .\nWell , uh\nEvery device\nWhat if not ?\nIt it should be . There should be really no problem .\nOkay .\nThey can be supplementary . That's no problem .\nYeah . Okay , um\nSo\nth\nSo uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar .\nBattery and solar , yeah .\nOkay . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?\nYeah , with colourful rubber .\nYeah .\nUh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish .\nOkay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red .  uh black and yellow .\nUh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .\nGrey and yellow .\nGrey yellow , okay .\nYellow case and grey buttons , I think .\nYeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course ,\nHmm .\nbut um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .\nOh , I think it's uh  it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?\nWell , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .\nI believe the  But you have already um  you must have a red uh on and off button . And um  Well  well\nWell , it it doesn't have to be red . Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image\nHmm .\nor or  I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .\nOkay .\nOr black and yellow .\nBlack and yellow , yeah .\nOkay ,\nbut uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But\nWell , there is .  Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print ,\nOh , I've read .\nYeah .\nwith  and uh\nYes . Yes ,\nNo .\nbut our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques .\nOkay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .\nSo  So I'm afraid it's not possible .\nYeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um  Um\nA scroll-wheel .\nThe scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .\nVoice recognition , of course .\nOkay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .\nYeah .\nAnd th the  they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .\nUh I'm going to leave that up to you two .\nWhat what did you say ?\nWell uh you can use  well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too .\nYeah .\nSo it has th the spongy uh feel also .\nYeah .\nYeah , or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber .\nI think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i\nYeah , b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .\n.\nWhat I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .\nUh is that  uh does our our supplier say so ?\nIt is not uh something uh  it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from\nUh didn't  did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?\nNo , but but uh it\n'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .\nYeah . You could place a  um uh this this would be the button .\nThere  the icons .\nThe scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place the indica th th the signals the\nYeah , b yeah .\nYes .\nYeah , that's possible ,\nThat's okay .\nSo you don't touch the icons that much .\nbut then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .\nNo no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or  But it's into the rubber .\nYeah . Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .\nYeah , but this is on the pla\nYou have to draw the\nYes , the signs .\nyeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean .\nYeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh  You just move the problem .\nWhat about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?\nUh I see what you mean . Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two .\nYeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel .\nYeah .\nBut the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber .\nMm-hmm .\nI mean\nWell , I'm I'm not so sure ,\nY uh can you separate these uh these\nI think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .\nI know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?\nI think both .\nI mean , I I never touch between the buttons .\nI do .\nI do .\nOr the s uh the sideways .\nI think\nOr the the back . Or the back .\nYeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the  these buttons ?\nI think  Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or  i you play with it .\nOkay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . I'm going to leave the decision to you ,\nYeah .\num because you have to make its prototype , and um  yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh\nYeah .\nOkay .\nso I'm going to leave it  the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?\nUm not quite . Um what about uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ?\nRegular .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nAnd\nUse with  .\nWell  no , I think that's about it . Yes .\nOkay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really\nThe only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all .\nOkay , well .\nAnd we've decided not to use L_C_D_ .\nYeah . Okay .\nSo\nUm okay , then I think we are uh quite finished . Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um\n. For the finishing touch .\nYeah ? Yeah , um if you write  wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?\nOkay . Okay .\nUh yeah .\nYeah .\nBut um Sebastian has everything .\nI know , but  well\nI'll put it online .\nGreat .\nRight .", "topic_id": 4, "keywords": "dynamo, solar, batteries, titanium, battery", "dialogue_id": 22}, {"text": "Okay . Hello everyone .\nHi .\nHi .\nHi .\nUm how uh how we doing ?\nYeah , good .\nUh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .\nMm-hmm .\nUm in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the  within the budget uh that was given . Uh in general  the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . Um it's also an item that people lose a lot . So we should address that . And , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use . In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive ,\nor like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 'cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work . Um also mentioned was it should be uh  it should have a very short learning curve . And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan .\nHmm .\nOur technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip\nthat has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . Therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . If too many buttons are pressed , mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um  you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . Francino who is our um\nInterface designer .\ninterface designer um uh has mentioned that the  that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . It should be compact . Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped . And maybe have an anar alarm-clock . And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature .\nAnd  even possibly a timer to  so that people can program  their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote .\nYes .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "marketing, items, product, idea, suggestions", "dialogue_id": 23}, {"text": "Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? Okay .\nYes .\nYeah .\nYeah , I think that pretty much is it . Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nOkay , then we  I'm looking for three presentations . And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh , I don't I don't think so , so whoever w wants\nOkay , I can start first .\nYeah , okay .\nOkay . Now my slide , please .\nOkay , your slides . Okay . Oh , come on , close already .\nAnd that's number two , right ?\nThree .\nThree .\nParticipant three . Yes . Okay .\nOkay .\nNow as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . Next , please . Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .\nNine what ? Nine channel uh switches ?\nPardon me ?\nNine channel switches ? Is  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nYes , nine numbers . And then you have swapping of uh button\nMm-hmm .\nby which  using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one .\nMm-hmm .\nGoing to the nex next .\nMm-hmm .\nNext slide , please .\nMm-hmm .\nThen you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume .\nMm-hmm .\nThen , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the  the subtitles on the screen .\nMm-hmm .\nThen there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . Now there should be a memory switch . There should be a mute button . Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch  he can uh  while talking he can watch the T_V_ . Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice\nMm-hmm .\nwhich can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see  we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the  uh yeah , the remote will  automatically it will switch to the ninth channel .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nSo the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nSo this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . So this is one one of the interface which can be created .\nMm-hmm .\nA very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features .\nMm-hmm .\nThen , please , next slide .\nMm-hmm .\nThen , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nSo uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . Even a kid can use that .\nMm-hmm .\nSo can you go on t t uh to the next slide . Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for T_V_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for V_C_R_ , D_V_D_s and audio . And this has in-built voice recogniser .\nCan you go on to the next slide ? Yeah , now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use .\nMm-hmm .\nUh this is user-friendly , it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it . And this comes with different colours , different shapes .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons\nand all the important uh buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . Next slide , please . Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace .\nYou don't know me .\nthis .\nI could lose that in a minute .\nSo this is   No this is a very big , you cannot  misplace it anywhere .\nSo this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose .\nMm-hmm .\nThis i this is one such interface which can be created .  And the personal preference  uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function .\nMm-hmm . Right .\nThank you , that's\nMm-hmm . Okay , thank you very much . Uh any comments on uh her presentation ?\nWell , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there .\nMm-hmm .\nUm what uh  I'm  No suggestion's bad .\nMm yes .\nBut uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . I don't think that we can get uh  The T-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny .\nOkay .\nUm I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter .\nYeah , I I th I think\nOkay .\nIt's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy .\nNo , I think the these are her presentations , but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after\nYeah mm . Mm-hmm . Have to come back to that later . Okay .\nWe can .\nbut if  I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation .\nNo , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . Yeah .\nMm right . Mm-hmm . Ho who wants to go next um ? Mm-hmm . Okay ,", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "presentations, presentation, interface, channel, channels", "dialogue_id": 23}, {"text": "Yeah , maybe .\nand you\nParticipant two .\nUh okay .\nUh the next one , sorry .\nOops .\nIt's it was the old one .\nThe components design .\nComponents .\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nUm this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design .\nMm-hmm .\nUh , can you go on to the next slide , please .\nMm-hmm .\nI have just brief  uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction .\nUh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , it's like  Uh it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just uh uh ,  you know , if you   if it falls down , then it doesn't  break . So it should be strong .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that . And it should be recyclable .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and uh  ,\nMm-hmm . Good point .\nyeah , and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components . And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit .\nUh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it  you should  we should have a highly sophisticated one . And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh  be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . And uh it should be with uh  um  equipped with timer and alarm facility . And the uh other component we should  uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through  through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery , capacitor . Can you go on to the next slide , please ?\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nUh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are  which we have to use in a remote controller . A battery uh , I would like to suggest one thing uh if we  uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much .\nMm-hmm .\nIt it it's not a high voltage battery . Then also we can  If it is a rechargeable one , then uh people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller . Can you go to the next slide , please . And how it works , how the remote controller works .\nGo away .\nThank you . Uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires ,\nand then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed .\nIt pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b  that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . Like  you have got a signal by pressing a button . That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . That is the use of transist transistor we  which we use in the remote controller . It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do . Then it will do the appropriate action . So uh this is how the remote controller works .\nIt works .\nCan you go to the next slide , please . Yeah , I have few pictures . When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's  it  this is a normal remote controller . And  to the next slide , please .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd where we had a a few buttons and all . And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nand also a capac uh a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm  yeah , and di and a diode transistor .\nMm-hmm .\nThe electronic components  uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d  diode transistors an Yeah , di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um .\nMm-hmm .\nMm yes .\nMm-hmm .\nYes .\nUh you can also see the uh uh the green  two green things are uh these are  they are  they are resistors ,\nMm-hmm .\nand uh just beside that you can see a transistor , and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor . Uh and also there are uh  um resistors  uh sorry , ther there is a diode .\nMm-hmm .\nCan you go  go on to the next slide .\nMm-hmm .\nSo uh this is the circuit board . The green one is a circuit board . Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , because uh  uh when you  when you are building uh some circuits  some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all .\nMm-hmm .\nIt's not exactly wires we are using . It's just printing something on a board .\nTha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits . So th that green uh thing is a circuit board , and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal  signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit .\nTransmit .\nCan you go to the next slide , please . Uh so this is  these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . Uh can you see the black uh , round marks ?\nMm-hmm .\nThey they are the circuits .\nYes .\nNext , please . And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like  instead off buttons we have some scrolls . Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh  uh uh full  a complete chip .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nUh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery , uh or we can use solar sells . Uh .\nHmm , that's interesting .\nYeah . Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases . Uh usually , the cases and card flat  that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller .\nOkay .\nUm .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nAnd you have more pictures . Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .\nYeah , maybe d uh I have just one more slide , I think . Um . Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use . Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re  or an advanced chip on the print , um also infra it includes the infrared se sender . Um yeah the uh  for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker . An Yeah , that's it . It's all for me now ,\nOkay , well thank you .\nthank you .\nAny particular comments by anybody ?\nUh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?\nNo , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh  which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think .\nMm-hmm .\nNow , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all .\nSo I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons .\nUm . We'll just go for push buttons\nYeah uh yeah , push-buttons . Yeah .\nPush-buttons .\nfor  in the interest of cost .\nYeah .\nOkay .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "components, component, electronics, remote, plastic", "dialogue_id": 23}, {"text": "We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her her thing .\nOkay . Go right to my first  my next slide .\nUh okay .\nUm alright , my method is uh  I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . I s I  spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . And I would encourage you all to do the same . Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . Um people like something that really fits in their hand .\n'Kay .\nSimple is beautiful . They don't want to have to squint at small print um , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , and they don't  care for the mode thing . They want each button to do something . And eye-catching is important . It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you . Um  and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . Ours has to be  look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . So we've gotta narrow our selection down to  li  two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . And I've been looking around um at what designs  every year different things are popular . And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them .

Mm-hmm .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nSo speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ?\nThis could be uh one feature which could be sellable .\nYeah , but w\nYeah h that could that could that could be our star feature .\nI think that's\nYeah .\nThat that  be really good , yeah , I agree with that .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how  how uh far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues .\nDistance problem ?\nYeah , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it's uh  everything so i\nUh .\nWell , you you teach  You have to teach uh\nSo to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think .\nNo , it's it's , uh yeah , it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user ,\nMm-hmm .\nI will already record uh a question like , uh good morning ,\nYeah , but  Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nlike around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on . It will recognise my voice and will switch on .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nOkay , before we get too far off here um , the components of the concept is the energy . What kind of energy do we foresee ?

Trendy design , compact and strong .\nYes .\nMm-hmm .\nUser interface concept , uh  interface type , supplements\nThat will be your area I think , right , Jana .\nUh . Um like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .\nPush-buttons .\nPut uh k I guess uh for\nPush-buttons .\nyeah . And  Not sure what they mean by supplements .\nAnd\nYeah .\nSupplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .\nWell , I think that  Yeah ,\nOh , like\nor  or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement .\nOh . A what ?\nHer speech recognition feature would be a supplement .\nRight , right , right , mm-hmm .\nRecogniser . Yes .\nMm yeah .\nOkay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .\nHmm .

Um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of  in uh in buying uh the remote controls . Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh  yeah , it feels uh good in your hand .\nMm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction . Um uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . Mm  It's okay . Yeah . I when we use a rubbled  a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to  uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh  Um\nOh .\nthe energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . Um , uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um  Uh here you have to have a hand uh  yeah , kinetic uh energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and  so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls .\nUm uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird .\nOh titanium is probably trendy , I think .  .\nThat's true , I guess . Yeah .\nWell , maybe a little bit expensive .\nI don't know .\nUh , they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium .\nHuh .\nUm the chip  uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . Um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . Mm , I've told about uh the three first points . Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros .\nTwelve and a half . Actually\nAh yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , production cost .\nI th I got an email with uh some examples and it  these were were the most trendiest one .\nYou see uh a covers , which can be\nWhat are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so\nUm , I don't know . Um\nBut it's actually kind of uh\nI\nwell , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj\nYes .\nYou know the the cartoonish  Alessi kind of design .\nYep .\nYes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh\nAnd we can we can steal their ideas .\nmaybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls .\nHuh .\nMaybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh with a  huge variety of uh\nWell , it's a possibility , too .\nuh house uh stuff .\nDifferent colours also .\nLike uh  maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this  in the same style , but\nUh-uh .\nYeah , that'll be for the future , I guess .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nNext time we're here .\nYes , because we have to uh  we have to   we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it .\nYeah .\nOh , okay .\nYeah .

Um , I don't know what costs of it . Uh , I've no idea about it . Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for  I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production .\nYeah .\nIf we got already uh something like a base .\nUh-huh .\nThat might get redundant also maybe . I don't know what kind of information it would\nYeah , I don't know . I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But\nMm yeah .\nYeah . Yeah , it's okay .\nMaybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t  to the remote control .\nThe remote control .\nThen you\na little uh too   A little bit\nand then you've got a flag s  Very big R_C_ . Yeah .\nOkay .  That's not   It was not a good idea .\nA little bit too big , I think . Exactly .\nOkay .\nUm , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think .\nNo . No .\nIt's it's just the base things we already discussed that the  no V_C_R_ or that kind of\nNo .\nuh , so that's very easy . Um\nBut you do mention the next and previous uh button .\nMm-hmm .\nWell , that's next channel . I mean  next channel .\nNext channel , previous channel .\nOh , okay , o okay okay .\nUh  Um  oh , I I got an email with   with an uh a remote control with a base .\nHuh .\nSo , it's uh just an idea . And I um   uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small\nBut you're the expert .\nI think it depends on the function .\nWell , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness .\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe it\nWell , if you save uh  Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course .\nWell uh\nokay , that's your point . Um , yeah . Yeah , okay .\nYeah , I've nothing to  s\nWell , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .\nOh , that's right .\nUh , with a little bit larger , yeah .\nYeah .\nI thought so , but maybe with the\nWell , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have  yeah , they have to be large .\nYeah , that groups .\nUh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the  to skip channels and to uh\nLarge ? Yeah .\nYep .\nI think  yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is  that's t trendy too ,\nMost  the most used uh buttons .\nThose are probably the the th\nbecause that's the mo it  it  you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ?

Yeah .\nThose are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control .\nYeah . And you want to acc accentuate that , you know .\nYou did the research .\nYeah .\nIt's from your research .\nSorry ? Yeah , sure .\nSo\nOkay .

And uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah\nuh uh v how do you say ?\nFor diversity or something . Uh\nYeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want  maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour .\nWell , how uh\nI mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever .

We have to make one design I th I I think .\nNo , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to .\nMayb maybe two or three .\nYeah .\nUh , it's  it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on .\nYeah .

W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ?\nUh , then you push a button .

Oh , well uh I've seen it done before .\nyou have the biggest uh\nDo you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays ,\nYeah .\nbut then it's very functional to indicate which  what uh uh device you are controlling .

But , uh do w gonna  gonna  are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ?

Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button .\nThe volume , teletext and\nAnd maybe want to access a a menu or something . Most T_V_s have a menu .\nYeah , but that's that's  I was thinking that's gotta be on the television .\nYeah , but I think you ha I really need a menu button .\nYeah yeah yeah yeah , b\nThat's just i the only button  only\nYeah , but wha what kind of menu ?\nYou know , I\nIs uh  isn't that different from every television ?\nNo , I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . And so\nMm .  Yeah , if it's c if  Yeah , I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh\nBut that that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then .\nand if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then\nBut then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right\nYeah .\nNo , you can use the\nYeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever .\nAnd you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that .\nOkay .\nTh in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem\nMm , yeah .

Yeah .\nOkay , that's not mu not much functions . So\nSomething important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess .\nYeah , definitely .\nUh , in one colour .\nAre we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ?\nJust use  I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side .\nUh\nYeah , that's true , that's true .\nAnd we will make it spongy and  and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did  I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh\nYeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w\nYeah , but we're gonna have to  we really have to think  I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but  and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you   it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy .\nYeah , definitely .\nUh , it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to  still have to think of how we manage to uh to get to that .\nYeah .\nOkay . Guess we're through then .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nI guess so .\nBut we  I think also we just  so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . I think that's uh adds to the\nYeah .\nYes .\ntoo much colour maybe m um\nToo much colour , i it uh  when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe\nBut our des design experts will uh work that out .\nYea yeah .\n.

I don't know .\nI hope so . And the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that .

I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . Um  Ryan is our User Interface Designer . And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart .\nUm we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . Um and we want to be different . Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand .

So um why don't um  Do each of you have a presentation ?", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, meetings, presentation, remote, agenda", "dialogue_id": 25}, {"text": "Yep .\nOkay . I'll hand it off to you and um  Does anyone  do you wanna go first ?\nSure .\nSo we can maybe see what uh what the people want .\nWhat was it ? Function ?\nEight . F_ eight .\nF_ eight ? Well .  How do I get it\nSlide show .\nTo go to the next one ?\nOh right right right .\nYeah you click on that guy .\nThat one ?\nYeah .\nOkay . Alright . Well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . Oh gosh , I've no idea .  G\nJust press the arrow keys I think . Usually goes to it .\nOkay .\nSorry I actually need to see something else on my screen .\nHit F_ eight again .\nYeah .\nI think .\nAnd then ? Again ?\nYeah . You want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ?\nNo I want something else on mine . Is that possible ?\nYeah but I think you have to hit escape . And then you can  Yeah .\nOkay but now you don't have that .\nOh hit F_ eight again .\nSorry guys .\nI know . I did the same thing .\nAnd then it should come up here shortly . 'Kay .\nSo is there no way I can give you the slideshow and\nI think  oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ?\nyeah . Yeah .\nMm .\nOh well .\nI'm not sure . You could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time I think .\nYeah . It's okay . Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research ,\nby um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research . And I was sent a report that was  I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . And if anyone could clarify what that means ?\nJust jus\nIs is it j just just\nZap , does that just mean like changing the channel ?\njust using it\nyeah .\nyeah .\nOkay .  Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take  thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ .\nA repetitive strain injury .\nWhat is it ?\nJust repetitive strain injury . I think . That's what I guess .\nOkay . Okay . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at  the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think  and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . And that's it .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "screen, slide, button, press, click", "dialogue_id": 25}, {"text": "'Kay . Very nice . Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . Uh\nWait can I look at that real quick ?  .\nOh yeah . Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ?\nYeah .\n'Kay .\nHaving just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well .   Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . Um  the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control .\nAnd t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to  i they're a nightmare to use . You have to set them , reset them to everything . Um and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . Um  Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . But one is uh user-centred . That is the one on the left . And you can straight away see there's less buttons . And the other one is  engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um   which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the  have said and the market research and stuff  probably looking at something that should be user-centred . Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away  if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under  some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um  Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings  market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And that's it .\ncable there . Thank you .\nWhat was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on uh the i\nOn something on the image of it .\nthe image of it .\nUh the f the actual design .\n'Kay . Good . Good .\nOkay . Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . Right . So unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it ,\nso um  I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . Um just  This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages .  Often in the form of infrared bits . This is the most mostly used . Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . Um parts are cheaper as well . A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . This is where my people screwed up basically .\nSo I'm going to explain that on the board rather . Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . We'll start with an energy source . Right . Um which is usually a battery right ?  Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself  . Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . Right ? This is the user interface and there we have the chip . Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . That sends out the signal . Of course the signal differs accordingly . Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . And  Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . You press something , you get a response . Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . It c it doesn't have to be there . This can be discussed as well .  The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . Or if we just do the usual button thing . Or we have a touch pad or something like that  that's something we can discuss . And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . Who knows ?  Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact  available cheap enough , developed enough . But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to\nSo we could  the the\nto the industrial design department .\nthe more complex we make it of course , the more expensive\nExpensive it's gonna be get uh . Yeah .\nBut people have said that they would  well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote .\nMm-hmm .\nSo possibly it might be worth the investment .\nRight .\nI think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o  if it's on your phone .\nYeah .\nI agree . Well\nAnd you need to sort of take into light languages and then  different dialects I suppose as well .\nI  myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end ,\nYeah .\nand you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly .\nYeah .\nSo maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then you know , you\nAnd wou I don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting\nVolume up . Volume down . Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ?\nYeah .\nI I don't know .\nAnother thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know .\nI think  As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nBut practically I don't think it's\nIt's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and\nYeah . It'll wear off .\nGets old yeah .\nOkay . Um  Let's see here .\nDo you wanna put your cord back in ?\nYeah I guess so .\nOh right .\nTrade you .\ngo .\nNow I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided  y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . And your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it . I think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons .\nMm .\nSo if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . Um no teletext . Um  So we don't have to worry about that . Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . And our corporate colours are grey and yellow . And we could probably get away with black too but  So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use . Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . We want something that looks good . Um we want something that's simple . We want something that you can find easily . Um  And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . It's gonna cost more . S the young the younger people say that they like it .\nMm-hmm .\nBut um it's probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . Um  And that way we can focus on our form .\nI did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . Is that  if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . Um that you you should put it back in . Your remote . But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep  to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought .\nThat'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball .\nYeah it would be quite good .\nOr or with  you know I guess with any form that that would be good .\nThe ball could sit on a\nMm .\nYou know that could be the charger . For you know\nYeah .\nwe could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . And that would be  or solar . Or you know  However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . Um\nYeah .\nWith the locator button . Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it .\nYeah .\nUm like\nWell\nif\nyou still do .\nwe still have the how to hold on to it\nYou s you still  W yeah . You put it on t on the couch table .\nIt's gonna roll away .\nWhile you're watching ,\nRolls away\nit's gonna roll off . So\nyeah .\nthat's not an issue really .\nUm  So I guess after the meeting  we'll have some questionnaires . And uh and some summaries for for what's going on . Um then we'll take lunch . Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . Um  I'll do the minutes . Uh let's see . It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . Um chips , the what chips we need\n.\nand what uh you know how to power it and whatnot . User interface concept , we want it to be something simple .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remote, remotely, control, controls, devices", "dialogue_id": 25}, {"text": "Yeah .\nUm  Minimal number of buttons . I guess our , I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know .\nYeah .\nRight . That's\nDid you have time earlier to to work on that . Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ?\nNot really .\nI'll yeah I'll have a look , try  look at the actual appearance in the next break .\n'Kay .\nI th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . The ball is probably not a good idea .\nMm .\nAnd even something that's held like that might be difficult .\nMm-hmm .\nSo that I think it still has to be a variation . On maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle .\nMm .\nUm  Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? That way we could l I mean if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ? Um  Would that  you think that would help us find um a specific form ? That we would would wanna pick out ?\nD I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . I  find anything more on that .\nMm . Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that .\n'Kay . So um we know that the remote's gonna have to be   we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . Um yellow and\nYeah .\nyou know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black .\nMm .\nAnd our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom\nor the\nBottom perhaps\nyou know . Um\nyeah .\nMaybe we could sketch a  so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . You know . Um maybe we could flare it or something . You know . So it's more  of course this will look like a bone then .\ngo ahead and erase this . Um  Hope everyone memorised that uh\nYou  I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm .\nThey've gone from big brick block things , which is  a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things .\nYeah everybody's got a mobile phone right ? Except for me now .  Uh\nBut they are all ,\nyou know , mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time .\nYeah .\nMm .\nRight .\nBut then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big\nand you had a handbag to carry it around in . Um\nSo we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . Um   Maybe we could go with a square or something . Um\nHm .\nUm you know with minimal number of buttons . I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . Uh you've got volume , up and down . Channel up and down .\nPower .\nPower . Usually at the top . Um a mute .\nThat's the classical design .\nThat's that's pretty much all you need I think . Um  A menu button , maybe .\nRight .\nSo you know . If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um  or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm\nTalking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad .\n'Kay so\nIt's\nUm\nTalk about maybe   f look at that from the side , there maybe .\nWhich is technically the easiest option . Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah . So .\nLike a wheel on your mouse .\nYeah , sort of like that .\nSort of .\nYou can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . Right .\n'S a good idea .\nAlso when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on .\nMm-hmm .\nI know . You know what I'm getting at here ,\nLook g yeah . Looks good .\nfel look at it from the side . It's  like that .\nMm-hmm .\nRight . Uh  Then you hold it in your hand like this . And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the  or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side .\nYes\nTo the thumb . Yeah .\nRight . Mm .\nTo the thumb yeah . Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here .\nRight . You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . With the lesser used functions on this part ,\nYeah . Behind .\nand then it slides into that part . And out .\nDefinitely .  just like o on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . So you know you just sort of have your hand\nMm well I was just thinking , this this of course causes\nYeah . Right on the  and your thumb would be up here type thing .\ncauses a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So .\nYeah that's also true .  instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person .\nRight .\nBut I mean  the older so\nYeah  is everyone  who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? You guys all right-handed ?\nRight .\nRight .\nRight-handed ,\nYeah . So\nyeah .\nI'm left-handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people .\nThat's right .\nUh-huh .\nLike the written language .  Or English .\nMaybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote .  Special order .\nMaybe . Ow . I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person .\nYeah .\nUm but that's that's good . That's  w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there . Um  At least for what buttons we're gonna use . Um  So we've got uh  I like the scroll , the scroll action and the   .\nI mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of  that sort of   the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . And then your thumb would do  you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . And that I think could work . On any hand . If you just had it like wrapped round there . Left or right .\nYeah . Kinda like holding a\nMm .\nRight .  That minimises it size-wise as well .\nMinimise its size . It could be you know really quite small .\nMm . Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nZapping functions .\nThat's it .\nYeah .\nMaybe .\nCould be good .\nSo two remotes in one . But then would be easier to lose one or the other .\nThat's right . Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . And perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around .\nYeah , yeah .\nIt actually is your coffee table .\nMake it a piece of furniture .\nyes . Yes , there you go .\nOr a statue or something .\nOkay .

This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh  personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . This is how today seems to be going to work . We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um  First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , right .

'Kay , so it's not the best picture in the world .\nHere we have an elephant . First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself ,\nand I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant . So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer .\nBrilliantly done .

Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . Right . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them .\nOh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made ,\nYep .\nokay .\nWell , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold .\nYeah .\nOkay . Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?\nWell , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you  you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of  three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance .\nOkay .\nUm b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket .\nOkay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our\nAbsolutely prohibitive ,\nyeah .\nyeah .\nOh .\nBut you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion .\nYeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g  I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some  and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for  um running macros .\nWould the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of\nFor instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um\nOkay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um\n'Kay\nAny takes on this ?\nWell um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and  the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games .\nOkay .\nSo perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television . They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins ,\nOkay .\nand slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that's\nYeah I've heard  I've seen the bar-code design before ,\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nyeah .\nYeah , it's it's taken out the  Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot .\nUh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that .\nOkay , well\n'Kay .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "euros, profiting, million, animals, drawing", "dialogue_id": 26}, {"text": "we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas ,\nYeah .\nwe can  we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so  we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind .

Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ?\nWell when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ?\nOh . Okay ,  .\nLike uh control pads , you know of games , but\nMm-hmm .\nor is that a bit ridiculous ?\nI I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to .

Alright . Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . Um  the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . Um and people lose them . And  We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um  that we're   we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That  um  we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh   Okay . So again um , I'll  we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . Um  now the the the internal chip um  and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice\nand given that  th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify .\nBut uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field and uh\nwe we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um  go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at .\nUh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k .\nOkay . Um\nKate . Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry .\nUm p there we go .\n'Kay , I'll just be talking about the components design . And   Okay , basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at  uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um .  Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip  the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh  which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which uh changes the channels .  Um . Oh .  Uh cool .  Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost . That's something we should think about . Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea .  Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be  allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert ,\nOkay ,\nso if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip .  And that pretty much sums it up .\nso how um  sorry , can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? Um .\nMm . Oh yep , sorry .  Yep .\nUh d d d  okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . Do we do we know uh by how much ?\nMm .  Um I don't actually have any price information , no .\nAnd and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip .\nUm it  a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . Oh w yeah , we did  the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed ,\nRight ,\nit's sort of still still in an ex experimental form ,\nokay .\nuh so it would uh  it's hard to predict the time .\nRight , I think we need to make a a decision here . Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply ,\nMm .\nthat would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ?\nI  I just have a question about that . Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um\nW just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick .\nand that w\nOnce you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world  the the sky is your limit ,\nOkay . Then it doesn't matter . Okay .\nbut to actually  the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working .\nOkay .\nCause uh I  must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . So uh um I mean\nYeah .\nI d d for slightly different  well no , I mean , it's if you you  speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean the this this information is from  is  this is the internal company information , is it ?\nUh bits of it , yeah .\nSo uh\nOf course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive ,\nYes , as well .\nyou know , hundred and fifty pounds or something . As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros .\nYeah , mm true , again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh\nuh decide .\nYeah .\nAlso lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so .\nMm .\nYeah , that's that's right . It's like  it's it's  you can't  'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is .\nYeah .\nBut we don't know . Um .  I mean uh I su i I mean if  given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk , uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um . Thoughts ?\nWell , another thought I\nWould\noh , sorry , go ahead .\nOh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um  maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .\nI mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ?\nUh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to\nI mean I think we\nOh yeah .\nMm .\nHm .\nOkay .\nWell , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing .\nYeah , I I I I I think that's uh\nMm .\nAnd we've been talking about it the whole time .\nYeah , yeah .\nMm , mm .\nAnyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it .\nMm , right , okay .\nMm .\nUh yeah ,  it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative .\nYeah .\nFrom uh my presentation show , so .\nYeah , it should be\nUh technologically innovative .\nRight , okay , so .\nNo ,\nFine . Okay .\nthat sounds good . Mm .\nI it will have voice recognition um uh\nMm . Cool .\nOkay .\nif if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b\nUm\nsecond question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down ,  volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ?\nYeah .\nYeah , I I would say we do , yeah .\nI think so .\nRight .

Okay ,\nYeah .\nso I did some research on the internet and um  what   you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , um commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . Um findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered\nMm-hmm .\nand these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual .\nMm , yeah .\nThere're some special ones available , like this one right here ,\nUh-huh .\nwhich is marketed towards children , um different designs ,\nAlright .\nand one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some  Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like  .\nSo just kind of minimise the clutter ,\nMm-hmm .\navoid too many buttons and also um  one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side ,\nMm .\nand then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .\nMm yeah . Sorry y y yeah ,  if I can interrupt you . Well d  p 'kay , do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ?\nMm .\nI mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable .\nUh   Uh I think they're they're about the same cost really . I I mean , I think it's just sort of  the the   there's a lot of slide buttons out there . I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm yeah .\nOkay , fair enough , fine .\nJust because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down\nMm .\nso I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down\nYeah . Good , good .\nand then the\nYeah .\nthis is my great little drawing .\nSo three three  there's three buttons on a slider .\nThree buttons , channel up channel up down and\nY yes , yes .\nWell , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . Because if it  if you no\nif you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of  if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what I mean , up like one unit , if you see what I mean .\nMm .\nYeah .\nSo it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something .\nUh-huh .\nSo you kinda take it up one at a time .\nOkay . Um\nThe only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel .\nD\nMm-hmm .\nOh .\nThis one on the one side and one\nUh you could you could  as l as like a mouse you could\nyeah . Okay .\nYe yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nso it'd be kinda good to have them be  feel completely different . You'd know what you were fiddling with .\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nor  yeah uh th th the  I mean thi this is what the\nThat was\nYeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , with a\nwe have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do .\nMm .\nYeah .\nOkay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a  uh volume and channel change\nUm well\nof one sort .\nI was thinking kind of just for the volume ,\nJust for the volume , uh .\nMm .\nbut what what do you guys think ?\nDep I dunno if it\nWe could\ndepending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno ,  it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb ,\nYeah , yeah .\nand then you could control the buttons with your fingers .\nFingers ,\nYeah ,\nyeah .\n'cause if  yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the  that for rolling ,\nIt  yeah , I mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it  the two are clearly different ,\nB\njust the way it would\nYeah .\nMm yeah , yeah , yeah .\nYeah .\num that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two .\nOh yeah , yeah .\nSo okay .

But uh I was gonna say um yeah ,\nWhat ?\nfruit and vegetables , uh important to  this year um important to furniture , I'm just gonna say uh  f like it's in  if if fashion  if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nBut fashions do don't last very long .\nWell that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year\nMm .\nand uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates ,\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it\nyeah .\nUh .\nYeah ,\nand then we can just whip that off and\nyeah .\nYeah like the kind you get on like hand weights . You know , that kind of spongy\nMm , yeah , that weird  I dunno what that is ,\nUh .\nbut yeah .\nyeah .\nA kind of  yeah .\nMm .\nAlso means you can drop it without damaging it .\nOh\nUh  , yeah , it's good as well . Mm-hmm .\nYeah .\nYeah , that's true .\nThat's  c cool . Um  you have  we could  if we could save  depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out .\nYeah .\nMm .\nI I mean it its uh I  that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion ,\nMm .\nbut it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . Um that's\nYeah .\nWh\nyes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity\nI  I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product .\nW I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time .\nYeah . Mm . Yeah .\nUm but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better .\nMm . Mm .\nWhat if we included the batteries in the cover ?\nMm-hmm .\nOh yeah . I like that .\nSo um\nThat all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers\nlike\nand  yeah .\nYeah , so can I see that thing ?\nS\nUm .\nYeah , yeah ,\nJust  this as examples .\nI n I know  the only p I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it  y you've then got the connection\nSo f\nand you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together\nUh yeah .\nand it it it  you know , total reliability ,\nMm .\nYeah , I guess that's true .\nbut I mean I d I I uh I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from .\nOr  well , but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different  like you've only got like , you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip\nMm-hmm .\nand this is the microphone . And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . And then\nI th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about uh  even if it costs slightly more than that , um just building the whole thing in one , then having  getting cheaper production costs\nYeah , you probably are right .\num and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh  a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't  it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally .\nMm .\nYeah , that's true .\nMm .\nUm then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote .\nYeah , yeah . Yeah .\nWell that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product .\nYeah .\nYeah , I mean it is  it's up to it's up to\nSo ,\nYeah , just another five Euro to get\nyeah .\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nit's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item .\nMm .\nRight .\nMm , yeah .\nUm and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available .\nMm .\nYeah .\nAnd um\nAnd that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly .\nthat's that's right , yeah , yeah .\nYeah , like they have for mobile phones\nYeah , yeah , exactly , exactly .\nthat are just fruits and animal prints and colours .\nYeah .\nSo uh i so uh okay .  Um right ,\nYeah , okay .\nsorry . Um we hadn't finished your\nUm  oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say uh  yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like uh  a part of the f like it it  the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ?\nIt's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me .\nMm . Mm-hmm .\nUm this is fashionable .\nYeah . This is fashionable\nYeah .\nwith\nI , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory . Um , so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh  I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else ,\nMm .\num w we need to decide on the  just the basic shape of the thing . And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look ,\nyou know , t to deliberately get away from the uh um  uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes\nMm .\nOh yeah .\nand , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um mm or uh  'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those .\nI dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a  you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it ,\nYeah uh the the uh   or or b\nbut I'd\nYeah ,\nyellow seems a bit of a strong colour\nlike an  .\nYeah , I'd I'd um\nto make the ent like the thing\nYeah .\nyeah . Uh no\nno , but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour .\nI d I I agree , I mean we're we're we're simply  it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah  . Mm  .\nAnd make that a fashion symbol as well .\nWell n\nWell , th this is  this is the whole point , yes , you know , I'm  I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever .\nAnd uh then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff .\nMm-hmm .\nWell I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um  a shape that's almost like a mouse .\nYeah .\nMm . Yeah .\nSo that , you know , when they hold it it's  because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm .\nhave the power , wherever , somewhere .\nYeah .\nI mean I've uh  yeah .\nI mean that was just an idea that I had .\nOh no that  well there's the sim  my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape\nYeah . Yeah , maybe .\nso that you can just sort of ho hold it .\nYeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though\nKind of a c\n'cause it  a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip .\nW it  I mean  well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse ,\nSo maybe it'd be\nYeah .\nYeah , yeah .\nSort of a combination .\nbut held , you know , so it's  you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , and fiddle around with it and press it .\nYeah so  yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had\nMaybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the  about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top\nYeah ,\nand you can fiddle\nthen wider up here .\nan yeah .\nAnd then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume\nYeah , yeah . Yeah . Mm .\nand the power could be wherever , up up the top or something .\nYeah , cool .\nWhat do you guys think about that ?\nOkay , yeah , yeah .\nYeah , that sounds  Um I'm just  I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much  how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to . I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ?\nYeah .\nOh yeah .\nIt's a very good point .\nYeah .\nIt is a very good point .\nI think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . That um the  we n\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nwe need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that uh  yeah  .\nYeah .\nBut  do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice  'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that\nThen you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it ,\nand it's microphone-esque ,\nYeah , and just say\nyeah , yeah .\nyeah , yeah .\nYeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff ,\nMm .\nbut maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .\nI th I th honest uh  my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um .\nMm I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing .\nIt's cer it's certainly possible I mean , but they  we we're going beyond w w\nBu Mm .\ngiven the state of the technology  we want something that we kno we know will will work um .\nHmm yeah .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "fashion, fashions, innovative, clothes, fashionable", "dialogue_id": 27}, {"text": "Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons .

Uh\nI  you know , on the basis that um that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um  make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years\nYeah .\nand that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um .\nAnd we're having a custom chip ?\nWe're having a a custom chip , but given the the  we've cut the functions down , um that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that um technol technological innovation is important ,\nthen we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate .\nUm and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um .\nAnd interchangeable case ?\nI i interchangeable case seems to be um  um important to the concept .\nMm .\nUm it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections .\nMm .\nYeah .\nAnd uh i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh  I mean uh uh this is totally new .\nMm , mm-hmm .\nWe d we don't know whether that  to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh  you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names ,\num it's uh it's good for the supermarket\nand it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better .\nAnd uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or\nUm the  that  I mean that's  no , because we've got so few buttons that it  that actually makes that redundant .\nMm , does actually , yeah , yeah .\nYeah , I think so too .\nCool .\nYeah , and especially for making them so like different and\nMm different to feel ,\nYeah , yeah .\nyeah , yeah .\nAnd the\nYeah .\nyou know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would  well that would clobber the battery life ,\nMm-hmm .

I'm also putting 'em  them in the shared folder .\nYep .\nSo um then I  we'll talk about our general objectives\nRight .\nand have your three presentations . Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . Finally we'll just close . We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . So  First of all the functional design objectives . Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the  functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . Okay , three presentations , um you can go in any order you choose um .\nMm shall we go in the order that you just did it ?\nSure , please do .\nI dunno . How do I hook my screen up ?\nI think , you might have to disconnect Rose .\nYes I do . Yeah .\nWell there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there\nWhere does it go ? Mm-hmm . Hmm , I'm not supposed to move this ,\nbut\nAh that's it , yep .\nAnd then you have to press function F_ eight\nFunction , F_ eight , yeah .\nI think it is on your laptop .\nThe blue one , F_N_ .\nWhere's function ? No signal .\nIs it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and\nYeah .\nAh , wait , 's screw in .\nI I think you just have to push it in really hard .\nPush the screw .\nThat's it .\nOh , got it .\nMm 'kay .\nMm alright\nIt's taking it a little bit\nI've never attached to anything .\nMm , neither have I .\n'Kay there you go .\nAlright , so ,\nAlright .\nI don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is . But , I don't even know how to play this . No .\nPress the little presentation . It's the um  it looks like a Y_ kind of  over there above Draw . There , that one , there you go .\nAlright . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research . They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly  , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they  more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . I don't know anything beyond what fancy means ,\nHmm .\nbut that's particularly of use to us , I think . Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions .\n'Kay .\nUm people also had certain frustrations , that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design . That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before\nHmm .\njust that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is ,\nRepetitive strain injury .\nbecause I don't know .\nRepetitive strain injury .\nWhat ? Ah . There we go .\nSo if you\nWow . People do not like that . So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on . So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly  and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that .\nHmm .\nThank you very much . That was that was great .\nMm 'kay .\nUm  's move on to the next presentation um on effects . Was that you ?\nHmm .\nGreat .\nYeah , have I unscrewed it ?\nPush . User interface , right . Interface .\nHere we go .\nCheers .\nMm-hmm . And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it .\nMm 'kay , thank you .\nOkay , great .\nOkay .\nHere we go . Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness . Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . Um . Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about\nh how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um ,\nHmm .\nand different different people sort of prefer different things . Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .\nHmm .\nSo I had a look on the  on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things  what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .\nUm on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control ,\nso it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can  you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . The one on the right is a lot more basic . It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . So we've got to to find our  find a way of striking a balance between the two . Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . It it does everything that I need it to uh , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . I also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed .\nMm 'kay . Thank you very much . That was very useful .  It's funny to see the  drastic difference between those two remotes .  Um .\nHmm .\nAnd neither of them were very pretty , you know ?\nYeah .\nNo .\nI think that could be our selling point .\nMm .\nA fashion fashion remote .\nRight .\nI think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool .\nMm .\nAnd I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress .\nMm-hmm .\nHmm .\nYeah .\nRight , I really can't see what I'm doing , so does anyone have a\nYou  there it is .\nAh-ha , look at that , showing up already .\nLovely .\nSo wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ?\nUh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah .\nOkay . 'Cause I was like googling\nHmm .\nYeah .\nand then I'm like wait  it won't let me google .\nAlright um  No , how do I play again ?\nUm the  it's right above Draw . There are three thingy if  it's way at the bottom . Under three icons\nAh .\nand it's the one that looks like a desk . Yeah , that one . There are Y_s  .\nOkay . So this is our working design presentation . Um I had a bit of  some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's  we're still in early stages . Um so , yeah , this is this . Though th the thing about working design is the  what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but  how do I get to the next s ah . So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done .\nSo wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen . So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . So um\nYou just press\nUh . Uh .\nyeah , just click . That'll be fine .\nSo the findings that I got uh very  just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . So that's one thing we're gonna work on . Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls  that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip  ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh .\nUm yeah use that thing  you can go back , previous .\nPrevious . Sorry about that , guys .\nPardon .\nOh .\nOh , well .\nNo , no , no , no , no .\nOkay .\nOkay , let's just get back to my schematic here .\nYe Double click on it . With the right  with the left hand one .\nW yeah , yeah . I think it's frozen . Here . Don't show me that tip again .\nThere we are .\nThere we are . Sorry about this , guys .\nI'm kind of pathetic with things like this . Um alright . So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way .\nMm-hmm .\nThis is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . And  personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated . We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around\nMm-hmm .\nand having to get frustrated and go do it by hands . So that's pretty much it for the working design .\nExcellent .  So , um .\nRose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ?\nYes , absolutely . Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things .\nYeah .\nLefty loosey , righty tighty , right ?\nYeah .\nWhat's up ?\nLefty loosey , righty tighty .\nLefty loosey . Uh .\nNever heard that before ,\nOh yes .\nthat's good .\nI'll think of that every time now .\nIt's gonna stick in your head .\nYeah , that's a good one it'll stick with you .\nMm 'kay . Um I have nothing on my screen . Just a sec . Here we are .\nMm . Ooh ,\nOkay , yeah , it's fine .\nno signal .\nOkay , requirements . We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this .\nOkay .\nWe didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because um  well it  that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about um  we're not gonna worry about that .\nWhat's teletext ?\nUm .\nUh , it's a British thing .\nOh . Oh ,\nYou don't have it in the States ?\nso\nIt\nNo .\nno . W d could  would you care to explain it ?\nOh , I didn't realise . Um yeah , it's like a  I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , uh y and you type in the page number you want ,\nMm-hmm .\nso like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing .\nS  Lottery numbers and sport scores .\nYep , news headlines .\nBut if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now , that's what they're talking about .\nHow ?\nIt's earl it's pretty old technology .\nOh .\nIt's like nineteen eighties .\nOkay .\nThat explains a lot .\nI have no idea why we don't have it , but\nThat's good .\nInteresting . Okay um , well , we're not gonna  the management has decided we're not gonna work with that . Um\nOkay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on .\nRight .\nUm otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out um very quickly . We only have a a short amount of time .\n'Kay .\nUm and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design .\nMm .\nSo what's our corporate image like ? It's  It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics .\nLooks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that  the emphasis on the R_s in um\nIt's like double R_ .\nmm-hmm .\nYeah .\nBut it's , yeah , we put the um fashion in electronics . So we gotta keep that in that in mind .\nOkay , so we want something that looks good\nYep . Yep .\nand is yellow .\nYeah , or  ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit .\nOkay .\nUm . Okay , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . We need to decide who our target group is . You um in your analysis of different market um  of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things\nMm-hmm .\nor had certain preferences , for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition , but younger people did .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and so who are we aiming this at ?\nWell if we're gonna say that function um fashion  we put the fashion in in electronics then you  automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that  that's  who's gonna be attracted to this .\nYes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?\nMm-hmm . It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember , so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is .\nMm-hmm .\nIs it  is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it .\nWell at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself .\nRight . Right , okay .\nThe only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea .\nMm-hmm .\nI dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range .\nYeah , that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us .\nYeah .\nNow , those are  that's all specific for speech recognition . Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?\nUm .\nMm .\nI I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying\nMm-hmm .\nuh , well , uh we've got a price limit of  was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for  to produce it ?\nMm .\nTo produce it , yeah .\nTo produce it , yes .\nAnd I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises .\nMm .\nBut what else are we gonna put , I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it , I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . So like other than just making it look good , how is it\nYeah .\nHmm .\nI mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons\nBut  right .\nand why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ?\nWell but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology ,\nMm-hmm .\nThat's a good thing to keep in mind .\nin fact it could use  it could mean , not . If   they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology .\nIf someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? I dunno .\nUpgrade ? Well , we can look for  we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly .\nYeah , simplification .\nSimplification ,\nThey could have a crap remote\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nso\nthat came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it .\nMm-hmm .\nUh-huh , mm . And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or\nHmm .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentations, presentation, designing, powerpoint, design", "dialogue_id": 29}, {"text": "Yeah .\nCan you like  I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons ,\nOoh .\nbut the rest of them like went in .\nThe remote\nDo you know what I'm saying ?\nKind of pull out of the side .\nThere are remote controls like that , yeah . Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it\nMm .\nthat hides all the complicated buttons .\nOoh .\nSo if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nand there's all the  all the special buttons .\n'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nand if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , that's a good idea .\nYeah .\nmore complicated ones ,\nI think that's a good idea , yeah .\nbut 's all still in one .\nMm .\nUm we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information , but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing . Um .\nYeah .\nGood point .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay um , so what are we emphasising ? I  what in this project ?\nSi simplicity and fashion .\nSimplicity and fashion .\nI think simplicity , fashion .\nYeah mm .\nOkay , those are very good goals , I think , um that we have to keep in mind in  with everything we do . Simplicity and fashion and , yeah ,  or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around a lot .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nUm .\nWhat can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? I'm just wondering .\nI think it's a lot  to do with battery , but that's just my\nOkay .\nThe battery and that  I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering .\nMm-hmm .\nSo 's just the quality of the chip .\nYeah . I think so .\nOkay .\nThe quality  uh quality of all the components really , I mean , we can't really do anything  shoddy work , 'cause it's\nYeah .\ngonna be visible down the line .\nSo our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?\nWell , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing\nS voice recognition , which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control ,\nYeah . Yeah . I don't .\nlike it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c , you know .\nIt's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech .\nMm-mm .\nSeems a little bit  Mm-hmm . Yeah ,\nYeah .\nand it might be too expensive .\nAnd if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_ .\nYeah .\nOoh .\nIt's for , like , the ultimately lazy people ,\nwho can't even be bothered to pick up the remote .\nYeah .\nMm yeah .\nI\nMaybe  I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nwhich isn't , I mean , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so\nYeah , but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something .\nUnder sixty five , okay ,\nYep .\nthat's a good start . Um . I'd say we're  uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? 'Cause that would go up to like fifty ?\nOr like single professionals or something .\nOkay , single\nTwenty to like fifty five .\nYeah .\nI dunno .\nIt's it's hard to narrow it down .\nIt's really hard to figure out right now .\nI think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages .\nMm-hmm .\nI mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons ,\nOkay .\nand that might be older people ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people .\nYeah .\nWell maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age ,\nRight .\nmaybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that ,\nYeah . Yeah aim for a  an income group .\nThat's a good point .\nlike , well\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nobviously it has to be someone who owns a television ,\nYeah .\nand like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing .\nMm .\nSo maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is\nYeah , t probably .\nYeah .\nbecause , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but  Okay . Um oh , there're a couple functions  do we want something so that  do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? Like a button on a T_V_ you can press\nMm .\nYeah .\nand it'll ring or something , I don't know like  or beep ?\nH I mean , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nAnd if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in .\nMm .\nIt would be relevant to like the overall goal I think ,\nMm .\nYeah , that'll probably be good .\nso\nOkay , we have to  we have about four minutes left to define our functions . So let's do that quickly . Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost .\nYeah .\nYep .\nAnd  we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . Large , accessible buttons for the essentials .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWe want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nWhich are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features .\nMm-hmm .\nHmm .\nUm , yeah , hidden way . And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah\non your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . Alright .\nOkay , do it . Any other essential functions that we need ? Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ?\nBattery battery use . Yeah , but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really .\nYeah .\nBut we might as well .\nSo you never have to change the battery .\nYeah .\nWe should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . I suspect the remote control does need a battery ,\nYeah , I would imagine .\nYeah .\nbut I dunno if you can\nJust 'cause it is an electronic device , the\nMm .\nYeah .\nIt  I think it does . I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one .\nYeah , without the energy , yeah .\nBut you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .\nYeah , that's that's possible . Yeah .\nYou could  we could maybe do that instead .\nCharging .\nSo you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery .\nYeah .\nI dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it  it stays in one place .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nWe have to think about um space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're\nMm .\nI mean , would you put it on top of the T_V_ ? I don't know , just think  okay , that's  that's a good idea , we'll keep it . Think it's\nYeah . That's just off the top of my head .\nAnd maybe fun . Okay . Um 'kay we're gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions and  'kay .\nYep .\nUm after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries  summary . I don't know what summarisation . Um and then we'll have our lunch break . After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides . If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great .

Maybe you can uh point them uh  The functions .\nUh , well the uh  all the functions are discussed uh  I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . Uh , it's a little bit . Uh , power button . Uh then the the the nine uh channels .\nUh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext\nOh no , the the the mute button misses now .\nI thought that was th\nAlright , I\nDo y do you\nOh , the mute button .\ndid we want to have a m mute button ?\nBut uh that\nYeah .\nIt's uh here then , in the middle .\nYeah .\nHuh .\nAlright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button .\nYes , um\nWell , yeah mo uh mo\nwe've disc\nYeah , well most of them are right-handed .\nMost of the users\nYeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the  on\nYeah well , I don't have time in uh anymore on the\nYes , y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh  yeah .\nYeah , and a and a triangle on that .\nOh yeah , just progr programme above , I think .\nYes . Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually .\nWait , there's  was one thing I wanted to ask .\nUh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh  do uh like\nuh d I call it teens and twenties . Uh , y th th th the two numbers .\nYes .\nAll n no , that's um  kinda dependent on the television .\nYeah , true , yeah .\nIt's a television . Yes .\nYeah , but do we have  do we need extra buttons ,\nUh\nfor example some uh some have to\nUh I think so .\nI think\nYes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh\nYeah , I think you should add\nZero ?\nA cross , or whatever . Yeah , line .\nYeah , but you don't you don't actually need them ,\nMay maybe here ?\nyes .\nbecau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds\nYeah . And then a second .\nNo , that's dependent on the television .\nNo , I don't think so .\nYes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press\nI do know so .\nIs it depending on television ?\nNah , I don't think so really ,\nYeah .\nbecause you have a  I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty  uh a number in the twenty or in the ten .\nYes , but but a lot  uh\nYes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um   they come with the television . Or actually , the other way around .\nNo , I think  uh I really think it's n\nBut\nbecause you can  when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one ,\nYeah .\nbecause it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply .\nYes , but\nYeah , well  but su  If\nsome televisions don't accept uh that that\nYeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing .\nNo , no , but s\nNo no no . So some television respond differently . Look , if uh i i\nNo , listen listen . When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it .\nYes . Yes , that's true .\nThe one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one .\nYeah . True .\nNo\nI think it works that way , really .\nNo , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space .\nYeah , but it's exact the same  that w would appear when you put a separate button  push a separate button .\nYes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons .\nYeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point .\nYep .  True .\nI think it's exact the same thing when y\nYou want  Yes , but some television don't support it .\nNo , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing .\nBut the ex\nListen , with  that that's that special but button  you're talking about , eh ? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in  on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . Do y you  the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had\nNo ,\nNo , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c\na remote can\nYeah .\nYes ,\nBut you give the input .\nso they need  no , they need\nYou push the one . That's the same thing as the button with the one and it\nNo , that's not true .\nyes it it is .\nIt's simply not true . It's simply not true .\nThink about it .\nYeah .\nNo ,\nYou uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something\nbut uh\nUh\nAnd it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one .\nNo , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . Remote control is a stupid thing . If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television .\nYeah , that's true . Yeah , but I m uh but it's  I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works .\nYeah , it\nBut okay , we we'll impl\nNo , definitely not . Definitely not .\nWe'll discuss them in the usability lab .\nNo , we'll apply them then for now .\nUh eva evaluation .\nI don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary .\nYeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two .\nYeah ?\nYeah , I think so . Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether\nOkay .\nAnd the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input .\nYes .\nAch .\nYeah but\nUh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess .\nokay .  What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nbut I still think i it it  all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . I think it's more c is m maybe we don't  uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works ,\nNo , no .\nbut I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said .\nUh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press .\nI do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M\nUh , some  N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten\nTh won't work wi with uh\nNo , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals .\nto have that special button .\nWhen you uh press one button , you give one signal . And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . But\nOkay , well we'll see .\nYep .\nWhen you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but  Just a basic idea of of of the most uh  most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote .\nOkay . I kinda miss the docking station .\nYeah .\nYes . It's here on the\nWell it\nyeah , uh there's nothing  I think it's pretty basic ,\nWe came uh\nthe the  there's no fu\nYes .\nthere's one there's one button ,\nNo nothing really trendy about it .\nthat's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it .\nBut maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell ,\nThe button .\nbecause Real  Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh\nYep .\nuh hearing devices .\nI think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices .\nYes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh  when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh\nYeah , of course . Mm-hmm . Well it it got it  it has got to fit into the shape , of course .\nYes , but we can make\nThe technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit .\nNo , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same .\nYeah , that's true , but uh\nWhen when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . Just have to be big enough for the biggest\nYes , but uh I I g Shouldn't it fall then ? It  isn't going to fall down ?  That's a bit uh\nNo , when you make it large enough no it it will not .\nyeah , I think\nBut then it's a little bit\nNo , but if if  like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this ,\nBut it's just an idea .\nI won't draw it really . If you got a base which is uh as big as this\nBut it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this .\nYou can . But i i i it's backwards .\nYeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can\nYes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big\nBut it's it's backwards . It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station .\nYeah . Uh , wha what you could do if you uh  from the bottom\nThat's text .\noh , right , help .\nBut\nUh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh  in in the\nYes , little holer  littler  Uh , little products go deeper in it .\nYeah . That i that is possible , yep .\nWell let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues  still to come .\nYeah , sure , you're right .\nYes . And uh uh\nOh .\nBut we have to look n I don't know .\nthe f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area .\nI don't like the colours . Mm-hmm .\nYeah .\nThen your uh left thumb of uh  your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb .\nOkay .\nSo it's it's it's really good design .\nYeah . Alright .\nYes . That's it ?\nYes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it .\nThe light . Okay . And other lights ?\nI think added lights are gonna be a problem too .\nYes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it .\nNo , o on the on the front . Yeah , okay . Maybe the uh the logo .\nYes .\nlights ?\nBut , it will also uh uh use batteries ,\nYeah , why not ?\nand do we want to\nOf course .\nOkay . For now , uh this is uh is good enough .\nMm .\nYeah , what was uh on the\nOkay .\nThe  all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh\nOkay , but in the  oh yeah , the colour , because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons .\nYes .\nAnd they're be a   they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side .\nYeah .\nYes .\nUh , in the same colour as the side .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nYeah , I think I think that'll be good .\nOkay . And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff\nYes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights ,\nYes .\nso it will uh\nYeah , we'll talk about the lights later . 'Cause I also don yeah ,\nYes .\nYep .\nit's depends on the costs and such . But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours ,\nYeah .\nbut may I dunno if that's important , but we'll talk about that later . Okay , for now this is this is okay .\nWe will .\nUm , the next p y you gonna give a presentation too ? Uh , I have to see the agenda .\nNo .\nWell , uh yeah , I I'm gonna do something right there , yeah .\nDetail design .\nWe gotta do that on the right   the most  right-most screen , because the leftmost", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "prototype, design, presentation, interface, functionality", "dialogue_id": 30}, {"text": "Evaluation criteria .\nYep , that's me .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nAlright . I will be needing that image , so leave it please . Um  Go away . Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points .  Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together .\nI wanna have a colour over here , come on . Right , the remote  is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so I  said not ugly instead of ugly .\nUh , what would you say , we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys .\nOkay .\nThe remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ?\nYeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , because it's  Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . Uh , I mean it's kind of  , our design . It's\nYes .\nso if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool .\nYeah .\nBackground colour .\nI don't know or uh I don't know how you  Casting . Yeah .\nI think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own\nHow do you guys feel ? The different designs .\nyes , you can make it in your own uh\nYes .\nYeah .\nmore to your own personality or or house style .\nOkay .\nYeah , but we d we didn't  we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe .\nNo , not not fronts , but different designs .\nWith a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay .\nNo , not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe , yeah .\nYes .\nAnd that's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , I guess .\nOkay , but  Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our\nWhat ? Yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? Personally .\nYeah .\nOr forty .\nWe can make it a one .\nPersonally . Yes , but what is it ?\nI think two or three .\nMm yeah .\nGuido ?\nI agree .\nTwo or three .\nUm , I uh I go for the positive . So I go for two .\nI was  I was thinking about three , so I guess\nUh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh\nOkay , three .\nthree is uh a bit uh  oh , what am I doing ? I'll mark it . The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy .\nYeah .\nYeah well , let that  let's make that a one .\nYes .\nTwo . One . One .\nYeah ?\nYes .\nAntek , you agree ?\nOkay yeah , I'll I'll agree .\nYes .\nThat's one thing for sure .\nYeah . You're not Antek .\nI'm the I'm the usability , so\nI totally agree . The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible .\nYes .\nYeah .\nYeah , two or a one , I guess .\nThe\nIt's something we really put work into .\nYeah , I  yeah .\nIt's all about the buttons .\nI would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant .  And our  oh yeah , it's a b yeah . Yeah ? Alright . That's a one ? You agree ?\nYeah .\nThe remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . I think we totally succeeded there .\nBut\nWell\nWell maybe a two , because of the menu button or something .\nOh\nYeah , well menu  Yeah , maybe .\nYeah , that's true . That's true .\nAnd telete\nAlso , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits ,\nYeah , we don't know if the  uh they're necessary .\no they're used uh uh\nthe the  yeah , m well , you d you've got a point .\nI think a two .\nYeah , true . Yeah , I agree .\nCan  yes , three , two .\nCame a long way , but not  we didn't not uh\nTwo or three ?\nMm two .\nBut you can't make a remote control without them ,\nTwo ? Antek .\nBecause we got\nbecause\nNay that that that's true , that's true . They're definitely needed .\nNo , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is\nSo  we put it on a two ?\nyeah .\nYes .\nThe remote control has got a really trendy look .\nYes . A one .\nYeah , uh a t I think a two .\nMaarten .\nWell .\nYeah yeah , y i it's hard to say from this picture .\nYeah .\nWe  we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever .\nYeah .\nEver , yeah .\nGuido .\nBut I do think it's more\nUh , I will I will make it a three , because uh  yeah . I I th\nBut I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful .\nYes .\nYeah , uh I agree . I agree .\nSo so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the\nYeah . True , yeah .\nI was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh\nA th a three .\noh , yeah , that's true . You agree on the two ?\nYeah .\nI i uh when you compare to the\nYes .\nGreat . Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .\nUh uh what's the difference with\nUh , I copied that one . Well , uh forget that .\nOkay .\nUm  Go away . Remote control has got innovative technology implanted .\nNo . We're not\nNo .\nNo .\nwell , maybe the the the  on the side .\nNo , not L_C_D_ , so .\nYeah , but we uh   you mean the rubber stuff ?\nYeah , and the light .\nYeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh .\nAnd the light maybe .\nBut that that's not innovative .\nBut\nAnd I don't u also it's also really not innovative ,\nLights lights are\nWell , I g\nit's more\nIt's not  seven ?\nNo , six . Or seven maybe ,  yeah .\nWell , six . No , six .\nOr six .\nSix .\nWhy uh why not a seven ?\nSix .\nYeah , mine is seven .\nBecause we've tried to make it a little bit innovative ,\nYeah .\nbut it but it\nUh it's uh depends on the on the maybe\nHow ?\nWith the lights it  it's it's kind of future\nNo , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it .\nYeah , you think the lights are innovative ? Well , it's n true . Uh , I agree ,\nBut still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the  with\nm but\nInnovative in generally or just f original for\nI'll  Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station .\nYes .  The docking station is a is a little bit innovative .\nN no no ,\nYeah , it it's  I think I think with its\nt  .\nA docking station is innova\nYeah , I mean the dock station , but but uh , I think the the docking station ,  it's gonna be a  kind of a problem .\nIt's a part of the remote .\nI think more m\nOkay .\nAnd with the speaker on the  there's also a speaker .\nBut\nUh that  that's n\nWell , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . Well I i  yeah .\nOkay .\nNo ?\nNo uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we\nOkay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev\nIt's it's a six .\nsix maybe ,\nSix .\nbecause\nBut the retrieval or the\nThat m f\nYeah , but I don't I don't know if it's very  inno yeah .\nYeah , for the retrieval function . Yeah . I think that's very innovative for a remote control .\nYeah , v\nYes ,  how would you innovate a remote control more ?\nYeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and\nTo put it on your head .\nno no , you know what I mean .\nYou have   must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your\nYeah sure , but\nyeah . Yeah , it's\nBut I d I definitely don't think it's a five ,\nthat's that's  think about it la later on\nbut\nand uh\nRemote control is easy to use .\nYeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least .\nYes .\nYeah , a two .\nYes .\nI think a two .\nYeah , it's good .\nYeah ?\nMore two .\nCome on . The remote control hasn't got uh   .\nNo , I would have seen  that one before . Oh , you skipped one uh\nI've just filled  uh\nUh , here .\nGo away .\nYou like the buttons .\nI found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten .\nRemote control will be bought by\nIt will be bought by people under the age of forty .\nYeah . Definitely .\nYes .\nYes .\nWell\nIn in  and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ?\nNo no no . No , just if they if they buy it .\nUh , just in general . Yeah , a two .\nWe don't know . But\nYeah , but I think I think two .\nYeah , what do you think ?\nYeah , I think two , yeah . I agree . Two .\nAntek ?\nYes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly .\nUh , that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty .\nNo , that's no comparison .\nYeah , you can  yeah , you can be very picky about it .\nAnd I don't mean two people .\nThis is just guessing .\nAh yeah , just make it  we'll make it a two .\nMake it a two .\nW w\nWhen it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu\nRight , the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan .\nOh no . Yeah . Yeah , you have make an\nWe don't have the slogan though .\nslogan is quite obvious  .\nOh , the slogan .\nOh the  oh sorry , no , not not the slogan .\nCan we see the slogan ?\nYeah , you can put that on the side if  if we would like to .\nThe logo .\nA logo .\nUnderneath it or something .\nYes , uh encrypted uh with\nYeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three .\nAre we gonna do that ?\nA three . Three .\nMaybe a three this time .\nYeah , a three .\nYes .\nThree ? I agree . Because of the slogan\nAnd uh\nRemote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users .\nUh , it's a one or a two .\nYeah , two .\nYes .\nYeah , make it a two .\nTwo .\nTwo ? Two . Alright . We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . Twenty six . It's a two point six .\nIt's not that bad .\nAlright , we\nYeah , and that's mostly the inno\nyeah .\nwhen we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two ,\nYeah . True .\nwhich is uh quite a great score . Okay . Uh , this is  was uh the evaluation ?\nThis was my evaluation . So\nBecause I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "colours, colour, designs, design, evaluation", "dialogue_id": 30}, {"text": "We did a pretty nice job until now .\nYeah .\nUm , is this your\nIs there something after this uh meeting ? Or\nWhatever . Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire .\nNo . Okay , yeah .\nOkay .\nStill opened or uh  Yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay , finance . Because um\nShoot .\nI received uh a spreadsheet .\nA five . A five .\nYeah , but I uh actually don't need this presentation , I guess . Oh .\nDoesn't matter .\nI'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because I didn't really fin uh I have a  .\nDidn't really finish it . Well , we uh  We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems .\nWe probably will .\nI probably have already opened it here .  try it again . First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . But let's let's st start with beginning . We include one battery . I i uh I'll explain its  Uh , the the components are listed over here . Uh , price is given . We um  yeah ,\nThe amount , yeah .\nwe we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . And then uh , we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet . I don't know if it's filled in properly . Okay , we need one battery . One battery . I think one battery is enough .\nYes .\nWe don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . A s okay , this this is a p first problem . Uh , I think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips\nUh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it .\nOkay . But\nThe simple chip is e enough I I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh\nI don't know\nWhere did we find this information ? Was it\nI haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really .\nI think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems .\nNo .\nNo , uh I  Yes , my my my uh\nYeah .\nThe the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip  maybe .\nYeah . And how do you know ? I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ?\nBec No , the  they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it .\nMaybe you can uh look it up right now . Okay , but  okay . When we don't  when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what\nThen it's a simple chip .\nthen it would be a simple chip . And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip .\nYes , I I I s I\nAlright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess .\nOkay .\nThat will be enough for future uh recommendations .\nYeah , but it will it will it will be  cause a lot of problems .  The sample sensor  sample speaker . What is it m is that the speaker we were t I don't know what it is .\nI don't know it uh either .\nI don't know .\nOkay , we went for the double-curved case\nYes .\nmade out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour . I guess that's what we were\nWell , special colour .  .\nYeah , I don't know about the special colour , but I think w uh\nOtherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour .\nI don't\nI don't know if it's very special .\nYeah , I think we uh we have special colours .\nMm okay .\nStandard rubber .\nAlright , that's okay .\nOkay , then the push-button , I was just counting them .\nSt\nUh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ?\nWhoa , it's a little\nWell that's bit of a problem ,\nYes .\nbecause I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet .\nThat's huge . No . We have  the simplest buttons .\nNo .\nYeah .\nNo , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much .\nI don't think so , because it says amount .\nIf you use a scroll-wheel\nAh . Yeah , it wouldn't\nThe the the yellow row is the amount of\nFill in the number of components you plan to use in the  and the total cost  I don't know . I\nMaybe it's the kind of push-buttons . You can have f four kind of push-buttons .\nUh , one til nine .\nRubber .\nIs that one or is that nine buttons ?\nYou can have uh\nAnd I count them like this . One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen .\nYeah .\nBecause  Oh , this is  oh , this is one , okay . Twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , I uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons .\nTo n\nDifferent ,\nthat's total of four buttons .\nYes .\nyes .\nAnd plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen .\nI think that  Eighteen . One two three four five , si\nWhy is that so uh expensive .\nYeah , I don't understand . Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons .\nIs it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ?\nFifty cents for one single stupid button .\nNo way .\nSo , whe when you  so then it\nWell , okay , well well let's make it just one .\nIt's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of\nHere , now it's now it's already s\nYeah , exactly . Yeah .\nshall we just give our own interpretation to ,\nbecause else we would really have a problem . It would be impossible to make it\nI can't\nIt's way\nI I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really .\nWhen you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board .\nAnd and less buttons than this isn't possible .\nAnd then throw it\nYeah , yeah ,\nThis is the most simple\nNo , no no .\nyeah , it is possible , but I've never seen one before .\nBut whe\nI've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume ,\nNo , really .\nYeah , without the numbers . That's possible . Yeah , we could skip the numbers .\nYeah , uh\nbut but\nYeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really .\nThat's still four .\nUh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control ,\nYeah .\nThen uh , teletext would also be im impossible .\nbut but it isn't fo Yes , it's for  it's li uh it's just for a little\nYeah , that's no option , that's no option .\nOkay , we'll we'll just  okay . But then still ,  when we  there's no room for a docking station or something . Tha w Le let's see th we have uh  oh yeah , button supplements . We'll give the buttons special colour . We'll give them a special form . Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it  this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess .\nA special colour , why a special colour ?\nBecause the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings .\nBut wha what s what special ?\nI think that's the  what they mean by a special colour .\nOkay , yeah .\nOtherwise , it\nUh , yeah .\nOtherwise it would be the\nI don't think the special form is really true .\nI think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , making it\nSpecial form also , it says .\nYeah , special material r also ,\nIs it ?\nbecause i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber .\nWhat is the normal material ?\nPlastic .\nYeah , I dunno .\nSh yeah .\nPlastic , I think .\nClassic ?\nPlastic .\nOh , plastic .\nPlastic .\n'Kay , but the problem now is that  the  There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents .\nYeah .\nBut we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station\nSeparately .\nSe no no no .\nyes . And and  but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of  can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station .\nYeah , yeah . Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we  yeah .\nIt uh  but it  then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can\nNo .\nNo , but you  otherwise you can't retrieve it .\nbut then you still have to use  we have to find out what chip we u need .\nYeah , I really don't get it . I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents .\nI think we can agree on this . I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 'Cause I think we uh\nYeah , yep .\nYeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean\nBut for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station .\nI think so , too . Oh , I don't know .\nBut can we find out uh about uh this chips ? Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only  we also need a simple chip .\nAnd then we can get a docking station .\nAnd maybe then we can do something extra . Oh , n uh oh , still\nFor\noh , it's gonna get more expensive with  . Two .\nThen we have some money left . We can put then\nFor two Euros .\nWe can put a scroll-wheel on it or something .\nUh why ?\nYeah , well who knows . Or a little bit of tin titanium .\nI mean i i if you  if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it .\nBut what what can we do\nYeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea .\nBut uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ?\nYeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know  then we exactly know what it will cost us .\nIf if i\nMaybe is that  that's nice to know .\nRegular chip and  because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example .\nYeah , bu bu but when we  yeah , but when we skip when we um  when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still  yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special ,\nI like the hand dynamo part .\nbecause that was our our special feature .\nWe can make a plain docking station for two Euros .\nYeah . We'll go back uh tomorrow .\nI mean\nYeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe\nWi wi without recharge\nIt still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material .\nYeah , but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . I mean , it has a shape .\nYeah , but for two Euros , then we have still  maybe we have to use the advanced chip ,\nOf course it has a shape , but i i\nthen two Euros isn't even possible .\nWhy should that not be possible ?\nYeah , then  because then we'd  thirty cents left .\nNo , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip .\nYeah , but  yeah , I don't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip .\nThat's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f\nYeah , and w and and we uh need f\nYes .\nIt isn't in my information , so I don't know it uh either .\nand what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker .\nIt isn't in my information , I uh I  I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or\nYou can look at it for s presentation . S technical functions ?\nNo .\nUh I've got here in uh\nNo no , they were uh mine , yeah .\nOh .\nI will put a I will put a page on it . When my mouse works again .\nOh , oh oh . Hey . Oh .\nMy mouse is uh\nDead .\nYes .\nReanimate it .\nDied .\nOh . Ah , I've got it . I will put uh my email on the the network .\nWhat the hell are these ?\nIt's on it .\nOh , whatever .\nYeah , it's open .\nMm . I don't think here  it's in here already .\nIt's circuit board . It's only just basics for for\nIt's nothing about s yeah .\nAt the end circuit there is an infrared LED .\nYes .\nThis isn't helpful .\nNo . But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . Which one was it ?\nComponents design .\nFunctional requirements ?\nUm\nNo , that was my presentation .\nComponents design maybe . N on top .\nYes , that was mine .\nAh . Ah yes , it was the second one .\nBut that was my second\nYeah , it was your second\nIt's already open .\nyour first presentation .\nIt's at the bottom .\nSorry ?\nWorking design .\nIt's uh at your task bar .\nYeah , but it's the the other one .\nOh .\nMm\nUh , this is n this is not this n\nWas it working design or components design ?\nSorry .\nthat's not the right one . I don't  oh .\nOkay , sorry .\nNo , this is the other one . Or maybe something is uh  maybe there's something abo in in these\nChip set .\nBut this is the same uh  This is o only the possibilities .\nHere .\nYeah . We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip .\nYeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything .\nThe display requires an advanced chip .\nYou know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires\nAh , okay .\nOkay , so we only need a simple chip .\nRequires .\nWith the light .\nLittle lights . Yeah , but that that's just the same as the the LED .\nNo no , that's just a simple chip . A scroll-wheel\nThat's not needed .\nit s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . So , we don't need any of them .\nA display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . For showing text .\nL_C_D_ .\nYeah .\nI don't think that uh just a l a little light\nNo . I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay .\nYeah , I agree .\nAnd what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ?\nMaybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down .\nYeah .\nYeah , I guess so too .\nYeah , true . Well , that's not too  what we want .\nNext channel . No . Well , we might want it , but\nOkay .\nAll in twelve Euros .\nBack to the costs .\nTwelve Euros and fifty cents .\nYeah .\nSo we're gonna use the simple chip .\nSo , simple chip is okay .\nGreat . Delete .\nAnd the lights . Where uh are the lights ?\nYeah .\nYeah , lights , yeah , there's no\nWell , there're three , I guess .\ncategory .\nNah , there is some money left to be spent .\nCan we do it wi within two two Euro ?\nI think we can make a docking station . Yeah .\nOkay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? But I mean it isn't  it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated  innovative te technology anyway , I think . I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would  wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy .\nMm-hmm . But it's original .\nBut what w is there some extra\nNo , that's true .\nmaybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . Instead of the rechargeable  the rechargeable thing was something to um  know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore .\nM bu\nMaybe we  if we put the kinetic thing in it\nBut but sometimes you put a\nYeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I  they will think about that . I mean if you u\nKinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking .\nThe uh  it's made for s people  well , the they don't  if it was uh uh r useless technology , they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility .\nUh solar cells are useless .\nAnd i it it  th th the the target\nOr the hand dynamo dynamo\nthe target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking  .\nYeah .\nBecause I think it  when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . Because it's one  it gets thrown around  thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot  Hey that  maybe that's cool  that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries .\nYeah , but but if we ca\nI've never seen it before in a remote control .\nBut then we could make a docking station .\nI don't know if  Five minutes .\nNo , we we we can't make a docking station anyway .\nThat's not true .\nYeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one\nWow , w why no li\nWe can make a docking station for two thirty .\nwe can still make\nLook at now , we got two\nFo  for a docking station .\nTwo thirty .\ntwo thirty left . Ca can't we make a docking station of that ?\nWe can make a docking station . Sure .\nWith a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it .\nSure .\nI don't know .\nThe power device is is i i is very cheap .\nThat's just a regular uh power cable and whatever .\nYeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control .\nWi with a button to\nWell , we we uh\nwi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep .\nSo .\nUh , so it's uh wireless technology .\nYeah .\nYeah , but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the  these costs of the speaker and other stuff . I don't think it's realistic for you to do so .\nWell then it's a useless project .\nLook at the case ,\nOh , because we\nthe case the case of of uh of uh\nYeah , then we don't have any innovation things .\nWe  well look at all the special stuff we have . Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . It  th this is whole concept . Uh maybe it  with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing .\nCan't we uh  Can't we say fifteen Euros ?\nUh , no .\nNo , sta yeah  I mean\nNo , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros .\nNo .\nNo , we only make less profit of it .\nIt's the\nYou can sell for twenty seven and a half . Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs .\nNo .\nYeah , I don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a  Uh uh I I I I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the  you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control .\nI don't think\nMaybe we can uh can do it both . Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic .\nNo .\nNo , that wouldn't n no .\nThirteen twenty .\nYeah , and it is also not a good  it's not  you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore .\nAnd I think only\nYes , but when it's  then when it\nYeah , but only kinetic , then you gotta\nNo no .\nthen you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty .\nYeah , it's great .\nYou you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really .\nNo no no . No no , this is very sophisticated technology technology .\nWhen you use it  your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it\nYou asked for three d No , that's n that's not true . Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time .\nNo .\nIt  We can make it  yeah  no . Becau be but a remote control gets  why do they state that this technology can be used if it\nYes , solar cells are also stated .\nYeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells .\nWhy don't we use solar cells then ?\nBecause I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and\nThat's true .\nYeah , it's funny for a week . I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating .\nYeah , but you don't have to . Trust me . The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens .\nNo , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously .\nOkay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what  that would just have a lack of key features , you know .\nOui .\nYou m have to put something on your box . You have to make people buy it and uh  We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not  yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out .\nYou can do it for fifty cents .\nWell , we've got more than fifty Cents .\nOkay , but we have to grou to agree upon something ,\nThe c  The case the case alone is is is uh\nbecause uh we only have a minute left or so .\nthe case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro . Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station .\nNo no , it's not possible . Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it's  this is  then then our concept is ready .\nCheap remote control .\nYeah , we make some extra profit of it .\nYeah .  No , we won't , but that's um something else .\nIt w it won't tell , but\nBut now\nNo , this not gonna sell . No .\nHuh , any ideas ?\nOf course not .\nNo , uh , n no\nGreat  . It's great .\nYeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over .\nOur remote control .\nWe come back tomorrow , okay ?\nNo no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left .\nYeah .\nYes .\nthe\nSeventy Euros .\nI mean we're gonna  it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel .\nNo , but  no .\nThat's what it's  makes it special . Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh I know it will work , but uh it's it's an  They're they're not putting technologies on this  , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen .\nWhy not a hand dynamo then ?\nOkay , well we leave it like this .

Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes , so you have to be very quick . And I have come up with the  management come with the new proposal , okay , and I have to discuss a few points on this . Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project . Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology . So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . And the second one is about uh the remote control . Should be used only for the T_V_ . That's what our uh management says . And the third point , it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product . Okay .  So I will invite uh  Agnes , can you go to the third slide ?\nNo , this is the third slide .\nOkay ,  .

Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . So uh , I also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as I said in the first meeting , um  and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product\nso that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth .  I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , so , I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic , which I kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off , that might be interesting . And um  so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get  would start off by the  you'd get  it would easily cause um problems . So , uh I  in addition to uh looking at the um  uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm  they  represent examples that are available today   which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind .\nFantastic .\nIt'd be easy to find . And um it would uh y you'd   you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . And since I'm not really um  Industrial Designer , I didn't really know what to do with this slide . But um  I just  took some  different uh schematics and I put them into this , and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board .  I don't know why um we were asked to do this . So , uh  personal preferences ,  um\nI think we could uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here , and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh   a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .\nSo something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . I think um it could either be  you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to um  uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the  of the user's home . Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups\nand , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . Um  if you uh mi one of  one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I don't know if it's actually understood my message , so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . And uh , course I never wanna replace the battery .  So ,\nthat's  those are my f preferences , and that's my presentation .\nYeah , let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable .\nYes .\nOkay , because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids ,\nokay , and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and  .\nRun over it with a car .\nYes . Okay , so if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , okay , I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , if I'm not wrong . Maybe you can uh add it in that .\nGood idea . Good idea , I'll I'll uh um  Yes , very good .\nOkay , uh thank you Christine , and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ?\nDo you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? 'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder ,\nHmm .\nwhereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable .\nTitanium . Titanium would be  be heavy , too ,\nTitanium .\nwouldn't it ?\nYeah .\nNo , I haven't really um  I wanted feedback , I think we need to rate  rank these , but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts .\nYeah . Sure , yeah . No , I just wondering whether  that you had any sort of\nI like titanium . It's light .\nYeah .\nUh  yeah\nExpensive .\nThe marketing comes out .\nbut uh who who said  who said we were ,\nYes .\nyou know , nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um\nYeah so\nIt'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though  .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "flashmatic, remotes, presentation, design, innovation", "dialogue_id": 31}, {"text": "Yeah the the  I'm sorry because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing .\nUh let me go quickly , maybe if I can go back  .

For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market . Okay ?\nMm-hmm .\nI'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh in a  in the recent surveys , uh from the ages  fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy .\nTwenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price .

Obviously the risk is there . Too expensive , they're not gonna buy .

I dunno , louder , softer , on , off . That might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this .\nThirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly .  Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time .\nSo maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home .\nBut , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible .

Do you think you can make it or uh\nD uh I'm sorry ?\nWhat do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about  of the speech recognition ?\nSpeech recognition .\nWell , uh training is always an issue with uh commands .\nMm-hmm .\nSo um  might uh  we can perhaps um  do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . Not sure how .  But um anyway , um  I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life . And um so , maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly so that uh  y you know sen send power to it . So uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there\nHmm .\nso that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things .\nIt seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , and it's words . It's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . It's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech . Otherwise , you can say remote .\nOff .\nBut if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your T_V_ .  So , I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then yeah , it'd be a really good marketing gimmick .\nMm .\nBut , I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation .\nVery good point .\nBecause tha w  with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea\nMm-hmm .\nbut th  if it's a one-word recognition , 'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States ,\nYeah .\na friend of mine says call Mom , and it calls up Mom .\nYeah .\n'Kay the radio can be on and everything .\nYep .\nBecause I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone   it has a exact word that it has to hear .\nMm-hmm .\nI don't think it would come through a sentence in a television . If somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote ,\nMm-hmm .\nokay . So I think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word\nOh yeah . Yeah . No , I think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements .\nLike the t like the telephone . No because I  this is this is years ago in the United States where we're driving down and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately\nYeah .\nso well , that's kinda cute .\nWell , what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , okay , uh if you need some uh  the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ , okay , because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , okay . And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . Okay , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project . I don't think it's uh the difficult . And uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what  today .\nOkay , we'll find that out .\nYep .\nFrom from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise .\nYes .\nWhat do they want ?\nYes .\nUh  , a risk , take a risk on the market ? Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ?\nYes . Yep .\nBecause it has to be something totally different , has to be total totally new . Something that nobody has right now .\nYeah but\nAnd it's gonna cost .\nbut end of the day , you're the sales guy , so I will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection ,\nokay . It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us\nMm-hmm .\nand how much you are going to benefit ,\nSure . Sure .\nokay . And uh , so I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of\nObviously .\nthe money from this project .\nIf the bottom line is positive .\nYes , okay I don't mind to convince the the management ,\nokay .\nMm .\nThe management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked , okay , they want something uh new , okay . I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , I don't think they'll say no for that , okay . And uh I hope I can convince the management on that , okay . So if you have any uh new ideas , okay , for uh your  you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any uh technical companies , which you can uh hide their technology backup , okay , for your uh functional design or technical design , okay , then I am ready to do that . And uh what's your comments about uh", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "remote, cost, costs, expensive, technology", "dialogue_id": 31}, {"text": "Um well , I mean , maybe if I go through my presentation , you can sort of see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments .\nMm .\nYeah , so you are finish , Ed , uh so I can uh\nYes . Mm .\nOkay , I'll uh hand over to Agnes . Just gonna close this . T Uh where are you , here ?\nMm participant three .\nParticipant three .\nNope , here\nOkay , so I'll  yep . Okay .\nGood .\nIs it okay ?\nThanks .\nAlri\nYeah , and that's fine . Okay . So , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . So , in our case , existing remote controls . And then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious . We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work . Um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . So , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever . So , the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . The buttons  it's not clear what they're supposed to do . Um often , you need to know specific button sequences  to get certain functionalities done , um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . And that the buttons are too small . So , here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons .\nThe buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . Um they're hard to see , and okay , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities  that are needed . And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .\nClick mm .\nWhich , I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably . Um so , that's pretty much it , an I don't know if you guys have any questions or\nOh , it's um , seems  very understandable . Clearly your research and uh  and ours uh heading in the same direction ,\nYep .\nand um uh the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it .\nYes , that's true . Yeah .\nSo uh , you know , but that's okay . That's why we're all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary .\nYeah .\nI also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nand that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel ,\nYeah .\nand uh , you're\nOh , that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an  daily basis in a lot of cases , I think .\nFirst . Yep . Mm-hmm .  Okay , so I don't have any questions . Sounds good .\nSo  for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me ,\nOh\nand uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim , okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all .\nShould we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include ,\nYeah .\n'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ?\nHmm .\nDo you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , maybe that would provide some guidance ?\nSure .\nDoesn't really tell us .\nSo not really this one we are talk ab\nIndividual actions .\nWell it says individual actions ,\nYep .\nit says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept ,\nMm-hmm .\nand you're supposed to keep watching the trends . Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . I think we should  do as many features as uh  start with all of them right now\nI thought\nand eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion .\nOkay , that will be great .  And uh I'll send you the the minutes of meet\nYou can object if you want to\nNo , I I'm just thinking in terms of time ,\nShe's objecting .\nlike if\nYeah .\nYes , now I'm objecting . No , I mean , I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , but\nI think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting ,\nOh th  we s we still have\nguess\n'cause w our meeting time has run out .\nYeah .\nSomebody else has go to use this room ,\nRight .\nSure .\nand , you know , we can't hang out here\nYeah .\nand talk about this , so\nYeah .

Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer  that uh looks would be very important on this new remote\nDesigner .\nand um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . Um .  Should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .\nUm\nAnd she was challenged on that point\nthat's right .\nYes .\nBut uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . The industrial designer um presented her uh  thoughts on the issue . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . Uh and of course a circuit board . And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse  morse code related relays the  uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider .\nOkay .\nShe would like uh  this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with  to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . She feels that's really what people want today . And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons .

Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal  it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared .\nMm-hmm ,\nYeah , okay , mm-hmm .\nmm-hmm .\nNow uh we have included the switch on and off button .\nMm-hmm .\nNow we have included another feature that is the mute button\nMm-hmm .\non the side of the model . Then we have included one to nine buttons\nMm-hmm .\nfor controlling the programmes  the different channels .\nMm-hmm .\nWe have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels .

Uh menu th menu , uh one one .\nYes , menu\nMenu button .\nAt the centre\nMm-hmm .\nwe have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness\nMm-hmm . Of the screen . Mm , mm-hmm .\nof this uh picture . We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button .\nThe next channel in the numeric pattern , or\nNo , swapping is if if example you're  you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .\nYeah , mm-hmm . Mm .\nYes .\nOkay , okay .\nAnd at the end , it  this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly .\nOkay . Mm-hmm .

Yeah , definitely .\nWill have symbols so that that  that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it\nYes , which can be easily recognised .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYes .\nYeah . Yeah .\nGood point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent .\nYes .\nYeah of course , and also\nYes .\nHmm .\nYeah . But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn\nYeah .\nYes .\nYeah we can  Text .\nSymbols on it . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nYes .\nText that we can have on the case itself ,\nThat's right .\nYes .\nwe can  it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm .\nAnd  and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .\nMm , 'kay , mm . Mm-hmm .\nA shell shape .\nFor the snail , yeah , mm-hmm ,\nRight , mm-hmm .\nYes , yes .\nYeah . So it is\nwe have the snail shell .\nMm-hmm .\nYes , snail shell .\nyeah ,\nHe goes right back into his shell .\nyeah  shell .\nRight .\nYes .\nWell you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow\nMm-hmm .\nand we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nY Yes\nYeah , of course , yeah .\nyou know that would , that would really work .\nNow what , what are our special features for the marketing ?\nSo\nThat's really the voice recognition that's really unusual\nI think voice recognition is our big selling point\nMm . Mm-hmm .\n'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range .\nMm .\nAnd then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use .\nYep\nYou know .\nuh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance .\nColours . Mm-hmm .\nWe're really gonna have the be the\nCutest .\ncutest remote control on the block .\nYeah .\nMm .\nSo I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition .\nMm-hmm .\nI think those are the two things to push .

I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that .

I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors .\nOkay .\nAnd our colour I think is great . The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it .\nUm I just realised one thing .\nYeah .\nIn the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .\nYes .\nYes .\nAh .\nYeah .\nAnd uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .\nWell , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ?\nEight , eight twenty , yes .\nEight twenty so\nAnd so we've got  we've still got four euros to go  to spend .\nWe have um four euros , yeah\nI mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean  four thirty .\nMm-hmm . Well um that's\nBut I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much .\nMm-hmm .\nSo um we just have to beware of that . I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWell as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality .\nYeah  .\nSo we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .\nYeah ,\nYes , yes .\nyeah .\nAnd um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .\nYeah .\nYeah , still .\nAs we've seen with so many of these kinds of products .\nYeah .\nI'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no  that that was not um included uh  that there was no room for any special features , okay ?\nIncluded , yeah . Hmm ,\nYeah mm .\nhmm\nSo to beware of that . You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?\nUh , well I isn't this my last slide ?\nI dunno .\nMaybe .\nYes it is . Mm-hmm .\nGo ahead . I think that was my last slide , yeah . Um . Mm okay . And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there .\nOh .\nI'm sorry I've um forgot to do that , um .\nWhy ? Wh why you need that up ?\nHmm ? Well because I can't remember what I put on there .  Okay .\nNow I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here .\nI think you can make it there .\nMm 'kay . You ready . So now we're all supposed to say what we think . Um okay so on shape I gave it a one . Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst .\nWorse , okay .\nUm what do you think the shape is ?\nOne .\nOne , okay , and Be Betsy ?\nYes I think uh shape is one .\nYeah , even my  yeah , shape is one .\nOkay , uh-huh one , okay . And how about on size ? On size\nYou  you gave it a four .\nI gave it a four , yeah , I feel it's just average .\nUm , I dunno . I think I would give it at least a two .\nOkay .\nOne .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , even I think it is one . It's quite small .\nOkay . Okay\nyou're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one .\nUm and then how about  how we doing on colour ?\nColour uh I\nColour , I gave it a one .\nOne .\nI really like all those nice bright , warm colours .\nI  I like the colours . One .\nOne . Yes .\nOne .\nYeah , one .\nOne , one , one , okay . And how about the feel ? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand .\nUh , I think I would give it a two .\nOkay , I gave it a three , two ,\nI'll give three .\nyeah ? Three .\nUh maybe two ,\nTwo , okay .\nyeah .\nAnd the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but\nWell it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more  is  are more tangible so from that point of view\nYeah . Mm-hmm .\nbut um  I'll give it a three .\nOkay .\nTwo .\nTwo , okay .\nUh three , mm-hmm .\nThree ? Okay . Well , um . It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting .\nYeah .\nBut um otherwise I think we're  we're ready to go to  go with this product . Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?\nUh . Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . Um . Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ?\nWe can always improve , yes .\nMaybe we can  yeah , include some more buttons and uh um\nYes , features .\nyeah features . We can make the buttons  few buttons smaller . Uh I think they are quite big , so I think  I  I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that .\nMm-hmm . Well then again if we're gonna um  do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech .\nYeah . Yeah , definitely .\nYes . Voices .\nMm-hmm .\nSo that that's where we're gonna have to do  maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .\nYeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons .\nYes . Yes .\nAnd um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control . Maybe we can put that all on one button .\nHmm .\nUm and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .\nY um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget\nMm-hmm .\nAnd maybe\nand that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things .\nMm-hmm . No .\nUh um we need uh  you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYes .\nMm-hmm .\nUm .\nMm-hmm .\nSo th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? Uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? Uh I think  personally I think uh I'm pretty happy .\nI'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um ,\nUm an\nEven I'm happy .\nit's something I think I can market . Yeah .\nYeah .\nand then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? Uh\nI think you've done a good job , Miss leader .\nYes , yes you've done a good job .\nYeah , yeah , definitely .\nAnd I think team work I think was very very good , I think we really\nMm-hmm .\nYeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , yeah . Mm-hmm .\nyeah .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nAnd uh I think we  are we happy with the means we used ? We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things .\nYeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah ,\nWhiteboard more , yes , yes .\nYeah , probably .\nwe didn't use that enough .\nYes , we could . Uh , it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit .\nMm-hmm .\nYes .\nAnd we used the slide because it was better positioned .\nYes , I think so , I think absolutely ,\nYeah .\nNo .\nMm I think that's true mm-hmm .\nand fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier .\nHmm .\nUm did we new  did we find new ideas ?\nYes .\nMm-hmm .\nI think we did .\nYeah , many .\nI think we were we were very good , yeah , mm .\nI think we we did , uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here .\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nAre the costs within budget ? Yes , yes . Uh is the project evaluated ? Yes .\nYes , yes .\nYeah .\nUm then celebration .\nCelebration .\nCel celebration  yes , yes .\nAh .\nToday we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne .\nSo I  I thank you all very much . Um , I think this was very good and um\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nI think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible . Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nSo , thank you .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nThank you .\nThank you very much .\nOkay . Watch I I have my cord behind you here .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nI always get it on here , but getting it off is\nDo we  do we have some time left ? Uh  you have\nThey say it's forty minutes .\nAh yes we have time later\nBut we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .\nbut we don't\nOkay .\nOh , alright .\nIt'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace .

So  Oh , good morning everyone .\nGood morning .\nGood morning .\nI'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting . I've prepared a little presentation . My name is  and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , as will I . Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you  on what actually is the project . This is uh the agenda for our first meeting . Um this is the opening , then we will get   I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . We'll do a little tool training with these two things . We'll take a look at the project plan . Uh there will be time for discussion . Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . And then we will close this session . Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room . Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . Um there are cameras\neverywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , and this isn't a pie , it's a a set of microphones\nand there are microphones here also . But please uh don't be afraid of them .\nThey won't hurt you . Um well uh\nWell\nI said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project . Let's start with the ladies   .\nWell uh I'm uh  and my uh function is User Interface Design , I think .\nSo uh that's me .\nOkay , uh I'm  uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh  look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project .\nOkay , so I .\nMe too .\nMy name's  . I'm uh  Marketing Expert .  My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other .\nOkay , well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company .\nThat's good . Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a  to design a new remote control which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly .  And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project  such a product . Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . Okay . But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things . They are smart boards . As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . And uh this one here is a white board . I will uh instruct you about that soon . Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then . Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance like this if everything's okay ,\nbut I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too .\nUm and then you can write things like test or whatever you want .\nOh .\nAs you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board .\nUh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left . And um you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results . Um does everyone understand this\nSo we can't erase anything .\nnice application ?\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWell you can erase it with the eraser , but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one .\nRight .\nS\nI will delete this one now because we don't use it yet .\nAlright .\nBut you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages . And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . Um that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal .\nIt's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing ,\nOkay .\nto do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . Well I'm not very good at drawing , but I will uh go first and um try to draw\nOr maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh .\nGood .\nHmm .\nNo .\nIt's a sheep .\nDinos\nSeal , a seal .\nDinosaur .\nBeaver .\nA beaver .\nA be\nWell it uh\nIt's weird .\ncould be everything .\nMm . With a tail and a mouth .\nMaybe when I put on\nIt has wings ?\nTurtle .\nthis thing it could be a turtle , or a snail ,\nSnail .\nWell the snail doesn't have legs .\nOkay .\nBut a turtle has . And those are slow . And I hope our project group will not be slow ,\nbut we will uh work to a good result\nand do it uh as fast as we can . Okay , time for another animal . Would you like to go next ?\nNo problem . No problem .\nSure .\nOh right .\nMm . It was four months ?\nNice , okay .\nWell .\nThe hell .\nTo make it a little bit easier .\nIt's a giraffe .\nMake that cute .\nOr a dinosaur .\nNo , it's a giraffe . 'Kay .\nI think it's easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe .\nYes . Giraffe .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck ,  it can reach everything . And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . So that's my favourite animal .\nOkay .\nAnything else you need to know ?\nCould you write the words , uh underneath it ? Or more words .\nOh , uh\nTall .\nTall . So ,\nShould I uh\n'kay .\nAlright .\nSo I can draw , but uh  Uh . Well .  Oh .\nB\nIt's a mouse .\nBunny rabbit .\nA bunny rabbit .\nOh wrong one . Uh .\nWell uh\nyou can guess what it is , I hope .\nUh-huh . No problem .\nLittle rabbits .\nIt's a rabbit .\nAnd uh well uh it's uh quick , I guess . That's uh my uh favourite animal .\nOkay , thank you .\nOkay .\nAnd our final drawing .\nBob Ross .\nA dolphin .\nOkay , um .\nDolphin .\nUh I uh draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence .\nRight .\nOne of the most intelligent uh\nMm-hmm .\nanimals in our world .\nWell .\nYeah intelligent .\nWith an E_ .\nI've I've uh\nEraser .\nYou can try out the eraser now .\nPen .

Well , nice animals , nice words . Sounds good . Um back to business , back to the money part . Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros . And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max . Okay , well it's time uh for some discussion . I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . Uh what's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you . What's your experience with remote control ?\nI always lose them .\nA lot of buttons . And you always lose them .\nYeah .\nYes .\nA lot of buttons which you don't use\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nor who you don't use\nComplex .\nYeah .\nComplex .\nNot user friendly .\nsearch for the buttons , which one is which\nNo .\nand uh\nNo .\nBoring .\nBoring , it's not fun to use a remote .\nNo .\nMm .\nBlack , all black .\nWell .\nMm-hmm .\nBlack colours .\nSo , yeah .\nWell maybe we should try to make it fun .\nMm-hmm .\nThey use batteries and  batteries uh and poor signal .\nMm-hmm .\nUh .\nYeah .\nPerhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls .\nThe the angle you have to use . You had different remote controls for different devices .\nYeah , different remote controls ,\nYes ,\nyeah .\nperhaps you can integrate them or something .\nYes .\nUh for the use of different uh devices  .\nYes .\nMm-hmm .\nYour stereo and your T_V_\nYeah .\nand uh . Perhaps that's an idea .\nYeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons ,\nYeah , that's right . And which you don't use .\nYeah\nso\nbut you could uh I thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection\nFlap\nRight .\nso that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em .\nyeah . Yeah , okay , that's possible ,\nThat's possible , so that you only get the\nbut it'll get very big the the remote control .\nYeah . You should just give it to  .\nNo n n no , just   Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , but um  the usual buttons such as uh um  zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly .\nMm-hmm .\nChanging channel .\nMm-hmm .\nOr uh  the numbers , of course .\nMm-hmm .  numbers .\nBut uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television .\nOn and off .\nYou only use those uh the first time , or .\nYeah ,\nSo . Uh .\nplay , pause , stop .\nMm-hmm . So maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons .\nYeah , I think so , yeah .\nYes . But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh ,  w\nMm-hmm , of course .\nYeah , uh teletext .\nwhat's the name ?\nMm-hmm .\nthink so .\nOkay .\nSo you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons\nNo .\nso they don't have to get out of their seat .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nBut\nRight .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remotes, remote, controls, buttons, control", "dialogue_id": 33}, {"text": "Because I think a market will be all kind of people .

Uh\nNo .\nYeah that's uh  .\nI think n m n most televisions nowadays do this .\nYeah , but uh they don't use the same signal , uh on remote control .\nWell not everywhere .\nSo  I think numerals .\nBecause you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television .\nYeah , but then you have to choose the  always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code .\nYeah , you can choose the code  .\nOkay . Okay . Okay . Okay ,\nYou can use which which type of television you have . That's no problem .

The number of uh  yeah .\nOkay .\nUm well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would\nAnd and does it\nif you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um  to make it  just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature ,\nMm-hmm .\nbecause it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  Yeah , I believe  Uh , push-button , well   It makes it the thirteen  yeah . Push-buttons are  buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost .\nHmm .\nSo um  yeah , th this design is not um within our price model .\nOkay .\nUm\nBut I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there .\nYeah .\nSo it's c way too expensive .\nIt's still too expensive , yeah . Um\nBut that's that's only for the buttons .\nI I guess if we leave the  if we leave this one out , um\nSo the button we can use plastic .\noh .\nAnd uh maybe not use the special form .\nAnd the pla uh  And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .\nBut it\nIt becomes a very dull remote control , I know .\nYes .\nBut it's the board decision . Um  And um  yeah .\nWell , b basically it   when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .\nYeah . Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an  uh focus on another uh\nSo  Type of m maybe another market segment .\nYeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic\nYeah .\nand uh m maximise the profits\nYes .\nand um\nThat's  maybe that's better .\nYeah .\nMaybe we could uh  we should go for straight and simple ,\nYeah .\nbut that's not what uh has been asked .\nI know , I know .\nSo we should kick the board's uh   Well\nYeah . Although I think we  yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already .\nHmm .\nUm so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .\nYes .\nUm but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no .  It's not that innovative .\nOr however you s pronounce that .\nYeah , too bad .\nUm so , okay .  Um  Oh ,\nthis is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign .  We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess\nUm well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway\nYeah .\nYeah , that's true .\nWell , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .\nWe l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree .\nSo\nWell", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "costs, cost, cents, euro, expensive", "dialogue_id": 34}, {"text": "Is it fancy ?\nI d it is it is\nUh\nYay . Is it ? Is it fancy ?\nYeah , I think so .\nUm the yellow rubber , I think so .\nI think so .\nYou like the rubber , uh Roo .\nI'm into it .\nSo uh one ?\nYeah .\nBut it's not that fancy .\nNo , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .\nI mean I think uh  I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing  the casing . It would be even more\nYou like tita\noh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it .\nThat's a flavour as well .\nIt has flavour . Yes , that's right .  You should taste it .\nRight . Um\nYeah , I know ,\nIs it uh\nbut but it  but that's fancy in the way um   I mean fancy has has a lot of\nIt has to do with fashion , I guess .\nYeah .\nIt's trendy trendy , fun\nSo do\nAnd w\nyeah .\nyeah , w what they want  wanted was uh colours and soft materials .\nYeah .\nSo in that way  It  it's fancy .\nIt applies . It  yeah .\nWell , just  give it a two .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYes .\nIt's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but\nI think I th I think it would have been  I would have think  uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .\nYeah , but that's sti that's uh\nSo\nLooking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't  we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . So I believe uh we are close uh to two .\nYes .\nYeah , I I agree .\nYes , I agree too . It's okay . We did   yes , we did good .\nOkay , and uh was it innovative ?\nWell ,\nwith the voice recognition feature and uh\nBut that's not in it . Ov or can we\nYep .\nNo , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .\nWell , let's let's  this product .\nOkay .\nSo I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .\nYeah .\nAnd the scroll uh wheel . The solar  not many remotes have the solar , I think .\nNo . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too\nYeah , and uh\nThat would have been a thrill .\nyes , but\nSo uh also a uh two ?\nI think uh it's a two .\nYep .\nIs it easy to use ?\nI'm not sure .  I'm not sure .\nYeah .\nWell yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard  it's not for the for the e for the elderly . They won't use it .\nWell , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use .\nYeah .\nThat's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced ,\nYeah .\nand I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .\nI think  I think a three .\nSo uh  It's maybe  it's not very uh easy for\nWouldn't give it more .\nUh I'm doubting  doubting as well . Um\nWell the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .\nOkay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .\nOkay .\nIt's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?\nYeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I   I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,\nYeah .\nbecause he is already  he or she is already an advanced user .\nYeah .\nSo\nUm  Okay .\nAfter all , I think  personally I would give a two . But\nUh Roo , a three ?\nYep .\nRuud ?\nGood question . Uh I'll go uh for the two .\nOkay .\nSo , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .\nSo I could make it e easy ?\nIf you make it a four it will be three in general .\nSo that's w No , two and a half .\nIf he makes it a four . Not a three .\nSix and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So\nDarn . Nee .\nYes .\nHmm ? Huh ?\nRoo .\nA seven , a three   No .\nYeah . I yeah  .\nA four and a three together .\nFour ?\nYeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ?\nYeah ,\nTwo ?\ntwo , two , three\nNo ,\nAnd a three ?\nI haven't said anything yet .\nNee . I know .\nNo .\nOkay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five .\nDivided by four .\nYes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three  three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four\nBut I'm filling in a three .\nThat's not even\nDoes it  will  so it will be a two point five .\nBut that's not possible to fill in ,\nYes , it is .\nso we have to round it .\nIs it easy to find ?\nI have a veto .  Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about  okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely .\nYeah ,\nYes .\nwe haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .\nIt it most definitely is  it's very easy .\nYeah , or beeps or  yeah .\nYeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh\nYes . Maybe  Uh I I think I think\nI'm here , I'm here .\nsomething like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that .\nYeah . Yeah .\nBut even without it\nYeah .\nWell , I uh\nSo , I th\nwe should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one .\nYeah .\nUm Sebastian ?\nYeah , me too .\nMe too .\nYeah , I agree .\nRight , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh\nit can't be more spongy . So\nWell , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is  um can be  uh how d how do you prono is is moldable .\nWas it one of our options ?\nNo , it's not one of our option ,\nNo . Uh\nNo okay , but but\nSo , in the in\nbut when you look in the market , when you look\nthis this was a most spongy option .\nfor the options given , it's the most spongy one .\nUh yes ,\nYeah .\nbut that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics  characteristics with uh market  uh with with the real market .\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there .\nThey're out there .\nBut I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .\nYeah .\nYes , but it's not good enough ,\nI'll give it a one .\nso it's a two .\nI wan I'll take one .\nYou take one ? What do you give it ?\nWell yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could\nYeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number .\nbut  yeah .\nBecause we need to go on  in  for the time .\nWell , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation .\nIt will be a one .\nSo I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .\nNo no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four .\nYou are\nokay .\nThe remote control offers enough features .\nWell , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?\nWell , the basic layout doesn't offem  offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So\nBasically it's it's completely programmable .\nYeah , depends .\nYeah .\nYou can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .\nYeah , I know .\nSo it's quite advanced .\nWhat what we didn't talk about is um uh\nYeah , but  it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's  If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is  it has all the features um a normal remote has .\nI think it has .\nUh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat\nYeah . Bec because you can um  we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So ,\nYes .\nyou place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um   the the signals .\nHas uh the signals sent to it .\nYeah .\nSignal .\nSo you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to  as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features .\nAbsolutely .\nAlthough there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .\nYes . But that  that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons .\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple .\nYep .\nYou can use your voice to to programme it . It's\nYeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the  for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .\nI'll give a two .\nYeah , I'll give it a one .\nUm I think think a one , 'cause  v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um\nYes . I I've  I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .\nYeah .\nSo\nSo high quality , low acceptance .\nHmm .\nThe product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But  whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is  well , is not sure .\nYes . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nD do you agree ?\nYes , I agree . I\nMaybe even because it doesn't look advanced .\nYeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh  function .\nYeah , okay .\nBut   Yes .\nBut we could  couldn't uh  what what's the selling price ? Fifty ?\nTwenty five Euros .\nUh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty .\nYeah .\nBut even now , if only our production costs w  uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was  were t uh was twenty two ?\nMm-hmm .\nSo uh  selling price uh would be uh\nM about fifty Euros .\nyeah .\nThat's quite ex\nThat's price , but w w\nwell , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .\nNo . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh\nYes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .\nYeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .\nBu but  well  yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .\nYes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .\nYeah .\nAnd it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition\n.\nand this one does .\nYeah .\nSo I think it's worth its price .\nOkay . Um you had an overall rating . Um\nYeah , but uh  with these ratings uh\nThat's counting .\nWell , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .\nshould be about one point s seven ,\nFour six seven eight .\nyeah .\nOkay .\nNine divided by six .\nOkay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um  What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ?\nTry to translate that .\nWell\nHmm .\nAny any other  Uh , Roo ?\nYeah , I think uh\nWell , I think\nYe\nRoo .\nThe process was good .\nBut w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .\nYeah .\nAnd and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made\nMm . Actually , we had\nthe the choice between  what\nBetter decision .\nYes .\nyeah .\nWe had we had too little information actually .\nYeah .\nSo  And uh um the the the  well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too  the the choice of components was way too narrow .\nLess . Yeah .\nSo there was not really a process of uh\nSo we could we we could be  we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .\nWell  Yes .\nThe prices .\nWell , in the first meeting we we already were very creative .\nYeah .\nWe we thought of possibilities  who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So\nYeah .\nWe're tempered by that , yes .\nOkay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ?\nNo , no .\nRuud ?\nI agree .\nYou agree , okay . Uh leadership .\nFantastic .\nOkay , Roo's on for his promotion .\nYeah ,  okay .\nOkay .\nI think we're a good team .\nI think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh  .  Um\nYeah .\nYes .\nWell , I tried once , but that was not allowed .\nYeah .  So um\nYeah , but but si uh w w w   when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well .\nI think so too .\nYeah . Um\nYeah .\nthe means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ?\nUh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad .\nYeah .\nBecause of the response\nIt  it's\nor\nResponse\nThe response is very slow\nand\nand the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate .\nOkay . Uh\nUh it it has  yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its  um uh where it uh\nDraws .\nYeah , where it draws . It's uh  the drawing on on the b on the board is  r right from the pen .\nOkay , so\nSo uh\nit it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ?\nYou to take in account that your  you m\nUh yeah .\nyeah uh\nMaybe it's  it needs to be calibrateds .\nIt's too slow\nIt it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting .\nIt is ?\nSo uh it's not the calibration ,\nOkay .\nit's the thing itself , I think .\nHmm .\nOkay .\nUh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ?\nNo .\nNot at all .\nNot really .\nOkay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing ,\nI I think so too .\nalthough I would like to see um O_C_R_ .\nYep .\nYes . Yes .\nIf it has O_C_R_  , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it .\nYeah .\nIt w it w yeah . It was necessary for me to uh\nTo digitise them .\nYeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it .\nYeah .\nI type faster than I write .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nSo\nBut I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .\nYeah .\nBecause you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy  it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way .\nYeah .\nI think it's a good product . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big .\nYeah .\nIt's not quite uh ergonomic . Eco ergonomic .\nEconomic .\nI know .\nYeah . Okay . Um  What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ?\nOh , I only use it to draw a rabbit ,\nYeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No .\nso   can't say much about it .\nI missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or\nYeah .\nYes .\nNo , or the other way around .\nOr the other way around , that you could show  but m\nYes , yes .\nBut y you can\nThat's quite what PowerPoint does .\nYeah .\nI know .\nif you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder .\nI know , but\nSo it's almost\nI know , but we couldn't use that feature ,\nyeah .\nso I missed it .\nYep .\nWe weren't able to do that . At least the  um I wasn't explained how to do such a th\nMm-hmm .  . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object .\nAn object , yes . Yes .\nI it's not possible\nThe drawing cap capabilities are very limited .\nyeah .\nOkay .\nAnd and uh w you were  when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing .\nYeah .\nAnd a lot of these buttons don't appear here . So it's\nOh it looks like paint actually .\nOkay , so y it  it's not even as advanced as paint .\nNot not uh n not  way .\nYeah .\nIt's quite uh limited .\nOkay . Uh no .\nYeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product .\nOkay . Oh , very good , celebration .\nCelebrate\nGreat .\nPop uh pop up the champagne .\nOkay .  Um\nIt was a privilege working with you .\nyou're dismissed .\nNo , I think we are uh ready .\nOkay .\nTo private rooms ?\nI see some action over there .\nPrivate room , Roo . That sounds quite scary .\nOkay .\nNo , let's find uh the way to  .   .\nuh we're done , we're finished ,  I believe . So , are there any more cycles in this process ? I think not .\nI don't believe so . Well , maybe we'd  get an email . Thank you for your\nBut um how much time did we get for this meeting ?\nForty minutes .\nAnd how much time is left ?\nA minute or or ten maybe . M\nTen minutes .\nYeah , ten or five .\nOkay . Okay .\nSo , we can uh redesign our uh  Uh I would like to\nWell , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box .\nAnd no added value . At all .\nNo , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market .\nSo\nOh .\nBut you see the problem ,\nYeah .\ny you can't continue your uh your line . Well , it's fluffy alright .  Spongy . A giraffe ?\nWhat is that ?\nYeah .\nIt's a giraffe eating a  eating leaves from a tree .\nIt's blue tongue .\nIn interesting design .\nYeah .  This is a new model . But\nSo you're actually promoting Bluetooth . Or blue tongue .\nBlue tongue .\nOh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling .\nIt's spongy .\nSo\nYeah .\n.  That is uh  it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices . Um\nBlue tongue .\nRight .\nOkay . Let's wrap it up .\nYeah , we're done here .\nGentlemen , thank you for your cooperation .\nThank you Mister manager .\nNow ,  let's have uh a bottle of champagne .\n.

Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings   , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this\nAnd I can start if you want . Mm .\nsure .\nIs there an order ? No .\nHm ?\nWe haven't decided on an order .\nNo , any any order's fine . Yeah .\nFirst . Okay . Um , how do I put this\nJust uh\nI'll just put the cable in .\nOh yeah , sorry .\nIs that it ? Can you see ?  Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ?\nIt sh it takes a few seconds I think .\nYou may need to\nWho's that ?\nNo .\nBut sometimes you have to do it\nIs it in the right thing ?\nit's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight .\nOh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me .\nUh-huh , and then press function .\nand F_ eight .\nYeah .\nCould you just plug it back into hers because she had\nOh , wait .\noh .\nThat's  is that it ?\nAdjusting .\nHere we are .\nThe cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it .\nRight here we are .\nOh . Is it on ?\nWe're here .\nOkay .\nOkay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .\nHm .\nUm , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than  you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .  And that's all I have to say about the matter ,  um .\n'Kay .\nShall I  what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?\nYeah . Just move right on .\nRight . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?\nUh function F_ eight .\nFunction F_ eight .\n'Kay . What's function ?\nIt's the little blue  w it's the one  th\nOh function , I see it .\nyeah . Yeah should be\nThere we go .\nIt should be  yeah .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, meetings, remotes, remote, sessions", "dialogue_id": 35}, {"text": "Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um  just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet  .\nAnd okay so basically um  I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um  so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that  like close together that um  are used in the same way , uh  or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh  can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um  does it do  or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um   I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but  And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .  Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um  like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .  That concludes my presentation .\nOkay . You need the little thingy . Ooh .\nHow do I um\nS That's on view .\nRight .\nOh .\nOkay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .\n'Kay .\nDo you know about like\nMm ?\nI dunno , you seem like you know about\nYeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here .\nOkay . Cool .\nOkay . Well thank you everybody . Um  we have  we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so   due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um ,\nalso our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something  I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah .  Do  Let's\nI guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can\nLike in terms of\nHow it looks or\nhow it looks , or like what it does ?\nwha what  um  well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s\nOkay .\nthe buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .\nYeah . Okay . So  Is our target group then people  so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?\nI think that seems to  yeah . Mm .\nSo\nIt's easy to implement .\nOkay . So the\nthe the buzzer you mean ,\nyeah , yeah , yeah .\nLocator .\nyeah , for sure , yeah .\nSo then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,\nYeah , teenagers and young professionals .\nwhat was it ?\nWell that's for speech recognition .\nOh , uh .\nWell\nOh .\nAnd screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen .\nI was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme ,\nYeah .\nand also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one ,\nYeah yeah yeah .\nMm .\nor  it seems like a silly ,\nYeah .\nI mean\nI'm not sure how you would implement it .\nYeah .\nI just put the values  in .\nAnd if if you consider our budget , it probably\nBut um the screen is the same as what ,\nIt's a cool idea but\nif you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .\nYeah .\nYeah , I'm happy with that .\nYeah  .\nRight so um  yeah .\nHu yeah .\nCompletely .\nOkay so are we gonna have just some kind of a  like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .\nWell you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place  since the T_V_ already has power .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .\nOkay . Okay .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .\nAlright .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nSo you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can\nIt would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote  .\nright . Yeah , yeah .\nSo do you plug it in the T_  you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?\nYeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .\nOkay . Okay .\nSo it's now like a two-part thing .\nYeah , so it would be a two part package .\nOkay . Alright .\nOkay .\nSo we get to design that too .\nMake it fashionable . Um , okay .\nSo do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .\nYeah I think so .\nYeah . Just there .\nHuh . Okay .\nMm . Are we um should that thing be on the  thing to put the  you s you talking about a home for it .\nYeah .\nDo you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?\nWe probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's\nOkay .\nYeah . Then it can live anywhere .\nYeah  .\nYeah .\nOkay . For the  so you have that button , that  so there's  is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?\nUm on the T_V_ or on the phone ?\nAre we just having a radio ? On the phone .\nUm it seemed like a  a beep seemed the most reasonable to me ,\nT\nYou don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah .\nYeah .\nI think that's what the phone has ,\nYeah yeah .\nYeah .\nI mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it  and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .\nAnd like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so\nYou can hear it's under the couch yeah .\nyeah .\nSo i Yeah .\nUm ,   So need the other buttons . So we have this  mm .\nSo I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them  , yeah you you did um ,\nThat was that was me .\nMm-hmm .\nthey're  I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .\nI think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes .\nOh really . 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities .\nAnd uh\nDoes anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across  international ?\nYeah .\nThey're not  no .\nThey're not , no .\nOkay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s .\nS\nYeah , that's right , yeah .\nIt not V_H_S_ here ?\nBut D_V_D_ probably is .\nYeah , other than that region and coding thing .\nUm\nAnd and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days .\nBut V_C_R_s  Yeah . Yeah , for sure .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can  I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take  like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,\nYeah .\nlike 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ .\nYeah .\nWell for sure we need the um  I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much ,\nS\nYeah .\nHuh .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\ns and it's usually that red\nYeah .\nand I think it's quite nice to keep it like red .\nYeah .\nYou know , I've seen some remotes that  where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just\nOh okay , yeah .\nIt seems like that would be hard though .\nBut\nI mean , like because unless you know\nIt might be confusing . Yeah .\nyeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't  I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button .\nYeah . Besides you like to be able to go power .\nYeah , I never think to hold something down .\nYeah .\nI have the power\nYeah . B  Yeah .\nI guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right .\nYeah .\nWell even um iPod thing   , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of\nThat sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .\nscrolling  I don't know .\nMm .\nYeah . Because people li seem  now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no  Know you don't have one two three four five\nYeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool ,\nMm .\nit's it's funny like you f like I just  I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and  it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know .\nYeah .\nYeah yeah , it's just  and it's one thing which has everything .\nYeah , and it is  yeah . It is really  but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?\nWell can't it tell the  like can't you  if you\nYeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .\nYeah . Okay .\nyou can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then\nYeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .\nOh that's gonna  Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of\nLike a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like  it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .\nokay . I've never used one . No .\nIt's like l this  like that , and then you do that .\nOkay . Okay .\nYeah . Yeah and then .\nAnd then you can have um   if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing  like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .\nOkay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that  Or it  oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can\nYeah , you can\nWell i\nzap .\nYeah , click o actually click on to have\nOkay .\nWe could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .\nYeah .\nYeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom  So do you need to\nDoesn't it rotate though ,\nokay .\nso it'll be moving around .\nWell y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like\nWhat do you mean the function ?\nI mean like okay , 'cause so  I dunno , I guess  Okay  so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nBut then\nYeah .\nso if you wanna switch to the  to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .\nYeah but it knows for some reason .\nIt just\nThe iPod knows .\nIt just kno  the iPod knows .  S\nIf it works on an iPod then it works .\nHuh .\nYeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .\nI don't have one .\nWell for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .\nOkay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .\nOh .\nSo it's like holding\nAnd then  well if you do that it goes , but if you  like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen .\nYou can  o And you you  is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually  you're just using the mouse to go up and down .\nWell what you\nLike\nIt's like a b\nfor the iPod you press an  w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm .\nBut if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure\nWell I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?\nYeah .\nLike you could just have\nI don't know ,\nOh , like\nyou could click and then have it up and down ,\nOh you could actually\nLike\nbut I think\nI think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod .\nYeah yeah yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah  .\nBut the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be  is that part of\nIs that what makes them expensi I think it's all of\nI don't think so .\nyeah , I dunno , I dunno .\nthey have so much memory though , that's  it's\nYou don't think so ? Okay .\nI don't think it's the wheel dealy .\nI think it\nYeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they  it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah .  .\nYeah . I'm thinking we could  if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .\nAnd they're re-programmable aren't they ?\nYeah .\nYou can put on your songs and then put on a different set ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nthat's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .\nYeah .\nS\nYeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah yeah yeah . Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation  , is that people find it  find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote\nYeah .\nand that's another thing they complained about .\nMm .\nYeah .\nUm , what other buttons were there ? Volume  oh we've ts just said that .\nSo okay .\nChannel selection .\nThis is just for T_V_ , it's not for  or it is  does need to be compatible with\nUm\nI  A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,\nYeah .\nYou know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things .\nSo how do you switch\nMenu .\nand menu maybe . Oh yeah .\nSo I'll I'll check that and update you on the next\nOkay . So like if we had that\nBut we'll hold off on that 'cause\nYeah .\nBut s yeah uh .\nBut D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote .\nThat's true , yeah .\nYeah .\nSo , I know I'm not c really clear on what\nBut it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nMm . Mm .\nSo you'd have to have like\nYeah .\nI think  you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can  you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So\nYeah .\nWell but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .\nYeah ,\nYeah , it is only fun\nbut I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .\nBut i Yeah .\nOh . But I think the circle only does  channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna\nYeah but it  it would be\nbut volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .\nSo  but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're  if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different  I mean do we need to think about that ,\nUm , yeah , let's think about it\nthat like\nYes we can try that .\n'cause we need to wrap up .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "buttons, programmable, design, coding, designs", "dialogue_id": 35}, {"text": "I wanna find our if our remote works .\nMe too .\nOh .\nOkay . Um here's the agenda for our last meeting .\nWhoohoo .\nUm after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . Oh , no , let's have the prototype presentation .\nMm 'kay ,\nyou ready ?\nUm sure . You or me ?\nY you read that stuff , since you wrote it .\nOkay . Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you .\nI'll be the Vanna .\nThe base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . Um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour .\nRight .\nUm and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through .\nHmm .\nIt's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow .\nThat's nice .\nYeah .\nThe whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it  just that one button will light up .\nGood .\nUm and then at the bottom we have our logo . Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_  which will actually look like our logo .\nGreat .\nAnd then on the side you have the buttons .  They're one button , but they kind of push up and down .\nOkay .\nI don't think they're scrolling .\nNo . They're just buttons .\nRight , yeah . And then  yeah , the buttons .\nOn off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know ,  can't see underneath .\nYeah .\nSo I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock  you know , stick your finger in . Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute ,\nThumb-shaped .\nYeah .\nand then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side .\nYeah . And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do .\nOkay . And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ?\nI'd say a single .\nSingle . Single sounds good ,\nSingle .\n'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double .\nYeah .\nYeah , it's only actually the size of my hand .\nRight .\nGreat . Great . I think you did an awesome job .\nYeah , I think it's a beautiful\nIt is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed .\nYeah .

Um , conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work .\n'Kay .\nOkay , right .

And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,\nYeah .\nsymbols you're meant to understand that you don't .\nSo simplification of symbols you could think of .\nUm . When they're  when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .\nOh yeah . Mm-hmm .\n'Cause it doesn't make  when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at ,\nMm .\nit's obvious what you're doing , um .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nActually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,\nMm-hmm . Menu , alright .\nI wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,\nYeah .\nUh uh\nso you've got a little L_C_D_ display .\nRight , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .\nWith menus , yeah , yeah .\nAnd if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .\nYeah .\nWhat about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?\nYou mean to save it lesser number .\nUm , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?\nRight .\nI don't think they tape things ,\nYeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so\nI don't think they use\nRight . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,\nYeah .\nthat's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,\nMm , yeah , the age gap .\nYeah , what it just needs to be  as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nI don't know , I d\nBut I don't know how\nI don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .\nOh yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nI find it really confusing , I kept getting lost  in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one\nRight .\nand I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me .\nYeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,\nYeah .\nyou'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .\nMm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?\nOkay .\nTeletext has got that option as well .\nObviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .\nYeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things\nMm-hmm .\nand also  and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .\nYeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is  you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .\nMm-hmm .\nMm , okay . S\nI think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about\nY\nIt might\nYeah ?\nit might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .\nMm-hmm .\nYes , no that's important .\nBut it might have its cost implications .\nYeah .\nYeah , like smaller .\nOkay .\nAnd there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?\nMm .\nRight .\nSomething that's easily moulded and produced .\nYeah .\nSorry I'm treading on your territory guys .\nUm , right , okay\nNo uh uh\nwe've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things .

Just just a quick thing about the um\nSure .\nabout what you're saying about the uh  does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of  I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh  we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui\nAh right .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nI mean you don't  you you can still have plastic\nSure b y yeah .\nand it'd look quite good but\nBut  yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know  th that was my main point ,\nYeah .\nwe don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper ,\nMm .\nI presume it would .\nI would\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nit would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything .

Okay . Oh , although I can't see it on my screen . That says go here . Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .\nWhich is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . Um , and all their positioning in the circuit .\nUm  Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?\nUh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced .\nYeah .\nWe can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .\nMm .\nOkay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally .  There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .\nUm  What is a hand-powered dynamo ?\nUm , where you manually charge up the power .\nJust every , every once in a while ?\nLike you wind up something .\nJust every once in a while or constantly ?\nSorry ? Yeah . Every once in a while I think\nAlright . It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think .\n. But it's  Yeah . It would be like going a step back in time .\nYeah .\nI don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology .\nNo .\nWhereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .\nRight .\nBut , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . Or too slidy . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back ,\n'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button .\nMm .\nBecause you can't really see which way round it is .\nRight .\nUm , we also can choose what materials  um , the  we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands .\nMm-hmm .\nWood .\nUm , again , stepping back in time again there .\nI don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here .\nYeah .\nUm , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects . Um right our choice for buttons as well . We've developed some  we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um ,  they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down . I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nUm one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it\nwe would have to have an L_C_D_ um\nYeah . That's true .\ndisplay , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult .\nAnd that would lead to an advanced  yeah . If we have  yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip .\nYeah .\nAnd it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget .\nMm-hmm .\nUm , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well .  . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different  depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton . Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display .\nRight .\nMy personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake .\nYeah .\nSounds brilliant to me .\nUh .\nRubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple ,\nthen we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one .\nYeah . Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these  chips and diodes and delicate technology as\nMm-hmm .\nlike as the exterior . This is the one thing that's protecting its innards .\nI think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human .\nYeah . Another thing is it might be more difficult  if it's a rubber exterior  talking about putting on interchangeable plates .\nYeah .\nUm , is it\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nI don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . It would work that way .\nMaybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case .\nW\nSo , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .\nLike plastic with rubber , kind of on top\nYeah .\nYeah .\nLike  I can't think of what .\nWell , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing ,\nYeah .\nYeah . Or like an\nb like a Nokia it is .\nMm-hmm .\nyou can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just  it's protective as well .\nIt's  yeah .\nYeah .\nLike the skin ?\nIt , it stops it , I mean ,\nYeah .\nit would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily .\nYeah .\nAlright . So maybe the\nI think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber .\nAnd then  yeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nAnd the buttons obviously are rubber .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nThat sounds good . I , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?\nAs far as I know . It should be .\nOkay ,\nwe'll just say yeah .\nYes , just why not .\nYeah . Yeah , yeah .\nAlright . I like the kinetic energy source idea .\nYeah .\nUm , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot .\nI thought that was\nBut I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um\nYeah , tha\nMm-hmm .\nenergy source . It could make an we could have any kind of style .\nYeah .\nIt wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and\nYeah .\nYeah . Just for environmental reasons .\nYeah .\nI guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before .\nYeah .\nSo it seems  we'd have to do more research on it .\nYeah .\nOr I dunno if you could have a battery pack .\nLike as a backup for something .\nBackup . Yeah .\nYeah so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo , if it was running off of one battery as a\nThat would be good yeah .\nYeah . Some alternative just in case something went wrong .\nRight .\nMaybe we could  you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power .\nThat's true . I just thought of that  .\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo maybe that could be incorporated as\nMay maybe that could be the backup .\nYeah .\nInstead of a battery .\nYeah .\nLike solar backup .\nAlthough it needs some light , doesn't it ?\nYeah . I suppose\nYeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then .\nDo , do those calculators\ns but some\nSo , if we're doing\nyeah .\nyeah . If we're\nBut thing is , it's not  you don't need the solar all the time .\nI don't know how it works .\nIt can be stored . It can be like  you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nIt just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nLike a few hours a day .  .\nI think that might be a little impractical though .\nYeah . I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion ,\nYeah .\nand  yeah .\nThat's true . It could easily\nYeah .\nLike people don't wanna have to worry about that .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today .\nYeah .\nLike if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYou don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever .\nYeah .\nAnd it works .\nOr just like pick it up when you're gonna use it .\nYeah . Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and  .\nYeah , I suppose .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAlright . Cool .\nK okay .\n'S that the end of your presentation .\nYeah .\nAlright .\nYeah .\nThank you .\nThere we go .\nThanks . Oh .  It's not on my screen .\nit wasn't on mine either .\nWhy ?\nI don't know why . I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there .\nYou don't know why ? Oh okay . Is it that one ?\nYeah . That's um\nYeah .\nUm , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or  by the human user . And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about .\nOh . Okay . Yeah .\nYeah . I'm not really sure about the pictures that  maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen .\nMm .\nOr maybe it's the the buttons or pictures or something .\nHmm .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nDo you think it's\nYeah , 'cause\nSo I suppose sometime\nI'm sorry ?\nafter you .\nUm , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm .\nSo you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics .\nI s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have  like the power would be s some kind of symbol .\nLike an L_C_D_ screen .\nAnd if you wanted to go onto teletext or ,\nYeah .\nI know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing ,\nYeah .\nyou , they have  there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which  I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button .\nYeah . Yeah .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentation, presentations, powerpoint, presenter, meeting", "dialogue_id": 38}, {"text": "But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that .\nYeah , we'll be doing\nIt'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .\nYeah .\nYeah . It'd be more a command interface , and then\nI suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?\nI\nThe infrared is like , that's considered a\nHmm ?\nNo I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per\nOkay . So when it says pointing device that doesn't include\nFor inp\nWell it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .\nYeah . I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things .\nMm .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nBut um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway ,\nYeah .\nto make it more simplistic . But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points ,\nMm-hmm .\nas in  just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe .\nWhat do you mean ?\nLike  I can't think of an example , but  Sort of like little pictures rather than\nOh yeah , like how the buttons\nLike a little sound . Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something .\nYeah , as a button though .\nYeah , something y\nMm .\nSo , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ?\nYeah m perha yeah . Yeah . Maybe .\nOkay . Yeah . I like that idea .\nUm , the co uh  we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly . Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . You know , make it more trendy and original . We'll have more money if we keep it simple .\nYeah . I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . A bit more too , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . Seeing as it's quite a new technology . Um   We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .\nYeah . That's true . That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things .\nYeah .\nIt can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming .\nYeah . And that all interfaces are different . So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand . And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .\nMm-hmm .\nYep .\nDoes anyone have any questions ?\nDo you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .\nMm .\nI think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . Just because of colour clashing ,\nYeah .\nand if we wanted to ,\nYeah .\nso and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .\nBut um\nBut what about the lighting up effect ?\nYou mean different colours for the lighting or\nUm , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would  if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up .\nMm-hmm . Oh I see what you're saying .\nIf they were white they would glow , probably .\nWell y\nIf they were made out of rubber .\nOh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .\nOh .\nOh .\nBut , but I guess , you mean from the back .\nWhere would the light come from ?\nOkay .\nI'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .\nYeah ,\nRight .\nand well rubber is a more translucent product too ,\nYeah , yeah .\nso we have that taken care of .\nIt should be able to\nMm-hmm .\nmm-hmm .\nIn the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber .\nLi yeah .\nSo you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . Do you know what I mean ?\nOh .\nOh .\n'Cause it's just the wee control ,\nYeah . They , they insert over .\nyeah , thing that's behind it .\nOkay .\nMm .\nSo  I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?\nMm-hmm .\nWell , if they're raised up buttons . So that you can feel them .\nYeah .\nWe were talking about it being more um , a lot more tangible .\nT\nUm , it might be more difficult to do . If they're , if they're sticking up .\nYeah .\nIf it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI think it would be possible . I don't think it would make that much difference . I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . And then you get to the circuit . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty .\nYeah . Okay .\nI'm sure that'd be fine .\nYeah .\nAlright . If it's do-able we can do .\nYeah , sounds good to me .\nSo that's everything , then ?\nOkay .\nAlright , thank you .\nOkay is that my turn then ?\nThat means you're up . Yeah .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "infrared, buttons, controls, remote, interface", "dialogue_id": 38}, {"text": "Alright .  I have a shorter report for you today . Um , it took a while to get this , uh  Uh .\nYou're not plugged in yet .\nOh .\nThat's a very good point .\nOkay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . Sorry . There we go . Um   So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . Um ,  so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying . The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the  face-plates . Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use .  So , pretty basic there . And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .  Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . Um  So , my personal preferences here , um of course , as  we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware .\nMm .\nI don't know if we wanna do it on remotes .\nIt could be one of the options .\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness .\nYeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . Everything else we can really , we can really\nIt is strange .\nMm-hmm .\num , do , according to our plans already , given the market . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control .\nIt's , it's a little  but it , it's everywhere .\nWell\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo maybe we  I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know .\nYeah .\nBut I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or\nBut they still need to um fit into people's decor though .\nYeah .\nOr colour schemes .\nWe  I think we possibly could take a more abstract design .\nRight .\nLike look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something .\nYeah .\nOr a strawberry seed or a leaf .\nYeah , yeah .\nThe  The essence of strawberry . Yeah .\nYeah .\nOr just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Instead of fruits and vegetables ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\njust  if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit  yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy  well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme .\nYeah .\nBut  may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know .\nYeah .\nBut initially , I dunno . I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit .\nTone it down . Yeah ,\nYeah and like not , not\nI guess , yeah .\nlike more like photos of fruit , on , on our product .\nYeah .\nyeah .\nOr banana-shaped .\nOne thing I was thinking though is\nI dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals .\nYeah .\nSo maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog .\nMm .\nUm , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . But it's something to keep in mind .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd , did you have any questions ? Pretty straightforward ?\nYeah um\nYeah .\nOkay .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "fashion, fashions, remotes, fashionable, design", "dialogue_id": 38}, {"text": "Alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again .\nThere you go .  Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the\nI didn't for the first one . But I have now .\nokay .\nBut it's still around right ?\nYeah . Uh , hopefully\nOkay .\nWhere do you have to save it to ?\n. Project documents I think .\nOkay .\nOkay . I'm just trying to make this pop up now . Alright . Here we go . Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . So energy , we\nOkay .\noh . Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting .\n'Kay .\nDoes anyone know how to take it out of  Um ,\nJust escape I think .\nThe PowerPoint ?\nyeah . Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ?\nKinetic yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay , so that's good .\nAre we going to have a backup ?\nHmm .\nOr do we just\nBut would a backup really be necessary ? I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's ,\nI think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy ,\nif there is backup .\nand be bold and innovative ,\nYeah .\nand hope this works , and well hope that it works .\nYeah .\nI think\nThere's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ?\nyeah . I think  no . I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential .\nSo\nYeah . It could even be one of our selling points .\nGo for it . It could be\nYeah .\nYeah .\nfully kinetic energy .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nEnvironmentally conscious or something .\nIs everyone happy with that ?\nSo if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nHope so .\nOkay .\nAlright , the next um decision is chip on print . I don't exactly know what that means .\nUm , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so\nRight , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ?\nYeah , it was\nYeah .\nso that was without the L_C_D_ . So that means we're not doing the advanced .\nYeah .\nSo it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons .\nI think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?\nUh , so that's the simple .\nYeah . I don\nYeah .\nyeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWould we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ?\nYeah possibly .\nYeah ?\nSo , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need .\nOkay .\nSo it's a medium .\nThat's called medium , or regular ?\nSo regular chip . Regular sorry .\n'Kay .\nRegular chip .\nOh , is regular not simple ?\nLighting .\nYeah .\nYeah if we\nIt's for the lighting , yeah .\nbecause of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well .\nRight right right .\nOkay , and cases . Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ?\nSo th I think this is just like gonna be the  a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .\nYeah .\nYeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber .\nRubber .\nYeah\nYeah .\nPlastic with rubber\nPlastic rubber coat .\nplastic coat .\ncoating and interchangeable um\nInterchangeable , yeah . Still going for that .\nyeah , interchangeable plates .\nYeah .\nOkay . User interface concept . This is your time to shine .\nWe decided on the component . I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um  PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component\nYour screen ?\nThink it was called command interface .\nWas it\nOh , yeah . Yeah .\nCommand interface ,  .\nThe command inter\nCommand interface .\nOuch .\nThe command line interface yeah .\nDid you say command line ? Okay .\nYeah .\nLine interface .\nAlright , and supplements . What's that all about ?\nUm , I think that is\nwell we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the  in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ?\nUm\nYou know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have .\nMm-hmm .\nWe haven't really decided what to do about that .\nUm , what are our choices here ?\nWell it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons . What kind of functions wi shall we have ?\nYou mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ?\nThe power . Volume .\nMm-hmm .\nUm\nSo pretty  just just the basic button functions .\nYeah . Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have\nMay yeah .\nUm , yeah .\nTone , contrast , and things . That's a bit\nThat was on , um one of my presentations . About how often it was used .\nYep .\nYeah , it was minima\nDo you remember that ?\nwell , it wasn't the l\nYeah , it was hardly ever used really .\nYeah .\nI w  Should I bring it up ?\nYeah . And most televisions will come with a remote .\nYeah . That would be good . Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television ,\nYeah , each television .\nYeah .\nso\n'Kay , well we know we want numbers .\nThe ch t Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . So tw twice every  once every two hours . Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . That's brightness , colour , tone , all that .\nMm . I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself ,\nYou don't change that often , yeah .\ndoesn't it ? I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote .\nYeah , it does .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and different televisions .\nYeah .\nLike we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of\nYeah .\nchanges like that .\nSo we're just going for power , channels , volume ,\nVolume .\nThe other one was audio settings . Mono , stereo , pitch . I mean I sometimes use that . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um\nYeah .\nand that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . Like almost once an hour .\nMm .\nYeah .\nUm , relevance of two .\nOh . We have five minutes to finish our meeting .\nCrap . Okay , um , let's do this fast . Um\nWell that didn't some up on mine .\nShould we have audio ? It only comes up on mine usually .\nIt w  it would seem silly if we'd  having anything else , just have an audio button though .\nOh .\nYeah ,\nDo you know ?\nI don't , I  it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we know that everyone has this and it's the same .\nBut we\nI've\nYeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it ,  mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons .\nYeah .\nThis one has channel , volume and your channe and your power .\nYeah , that's it . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic .\nThat could be a sales pitch .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSimple and\nYeah .\nYeah uh I\nOkay .\nAlright .\nbrilliant .\nYeah .\nGood . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . Wait a minute . Is that right ?\nMm-hmm .\nYep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product . Um , Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .\nAnd , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .\nOkay .\nAlright . So , anyone else have something to say ?\nUm , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nAre we  seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nUm , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ?\nNow do you guys need  want an idea of how many uh  are you gonna come up with casing ideas ?\nY Yeah .\nLike f five different\nYeah .\nfive .  .\nWhat I  What I was thinking  what do yous think of this ? Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle .\nMm-hmm .\nLike grapes . Like that's kind of fruity or something .\nYeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .\nMm-hmm .\nThat's just\nWe can have a look at those ideas , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well .\nYeah .\nSo it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . Something that your granny would want on her remote control .\nYeah .\nUm , and international tastes as well , so\nYeah .\nTricky .  A lot of things to consider . Hm .\nNot easy .\nYeah . Lots of\nYeah .\nyeah . Alright .\nOkay .\n'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then .\nAlright . And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes .\n'Kay .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nBye .\nOkay .\nThank you .\nI'll see you later .  Oh , what did I just do .

Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um\nYou have one in mind ?\nuh I think I have one in mind , so uh   I'm gonna   about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . The spider has a  spider lives in a web  and uh it has eight legs , and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . There are some spiders that live in like  that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh  build a new web somewhere else . So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh  well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away .\nOkay .\nSo , that's my animal .\nTh thank you .

Guillermo you want to ?\n'kay  I dunno why , but  when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther\nnot a pink panther ,\nBut don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther ?\nor maybe yes .\nIt would be very funny for us .\nUh yeah yeah .\nSo bad I don't like it .\nOh .\nOkay it's a friendly panther .\nMaybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone .\nYeah maybe  .\nUm . Actually , honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour , I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh , I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , so  but  I like it because it's fast , and it's black as well , so it can he  it can hide itself very easily and it's it's  it looks like um  powerful , strong , uh I dunno . I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and  I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot .\nOkay . Thank you .\nOkay .\nHemant .\nUm sure .\nSo you don't like pink panthers ?\nI like it  .\nOh yeah . Thanks . This lapel is coming out once in a while . It's not very strong . Okay . So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant .\nI'll try to draw elephant  . It's a problem . Okay , thanks . Okay so , elephant goes like this ,  and then it has four feet  . I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but I think this is the easiest . And then we have it's trunk . And yep something like this  .\nAn eye , cute  .\nYeah , so\nPoor elephant  .\nand sometimes they have a hump . It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way  a different way of walking . So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . That's the way they walk . And that's very peculiar about them . None of the other animals walk like this . And they are very useful to human beings . At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . And they are found in um usually the warm countries . And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . That's what I know about them . So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants .\nSo is this uh an Indian or an African elephant , 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ?\nThere are two kind of uh yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants . So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are Indian and  So at some  for some elephants it's  the trunk is having one  Do we have some message there ?\nYes . We have to  I have to catch you ,\nWind up\nsorry . We have to to go through the meeting .\n? Okay , some other time .\nOkay .\nThank you .\nThank you  .\nWe can discuss that off-line .\nYeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do  we'll do another meeting abo on elephants .\nThanks .\nSo", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "spider, spiders, drawn, web, legs", "dialogue_id": 39}, {"text": "so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about  so about finances . So  we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um   which which would generate a profit of of um  fifty million Euros , okay . And we should target the inter an international market .\nSo could I just ask one question , um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ?\nO this is the  next topic we have to discuss exactly ,\nOkay , alright .\nso let's go to it . So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? Should it be a universal one ? And uh etcetera . So um  so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go .\nOkay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to  a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , but I guess if that's  if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually  you know , what people ar are willing to pay for  um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro\nOkay .\nbecause it seems quite a lot for a remote control ,\nOkay I think this is more a job to our\nso it's\nmarket person yeah .\nMarketing person .\nYeah .\nSo it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go .\nMm-hmm .\nSo we need to close the meeting . Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so  the work every every of you ha have t d to do . So um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ?\nYeah .\nUm you will receive some information by emails , i as usual .

Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda  so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push .\nUh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on .\nUh-huh .\nUh that's the little menu key .

This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself\nYep .\njust kinda stretch it over\nand it'll be fine .\nOkay , good yeah .\nYeah .\nand it'll just stay on\nYeah .\nand then the buttons come through and so  and then the  each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ .\nYep , right .\nLi that'll be  the covers as well , yeah yeah .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nI mean tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered  I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ?\nLike that .\nRight . Okay  for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically\nYeah it could stand , yeah .\nbut uh uh\nOh .\nWell we could broaden the  broaden it out a bit\nYeah , uh no\nso it would stand like that .\nbecause  particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item\nYeah ,  standing .\nuh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh\nYeah , we could just widen it out uh\nYeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um\nMm . Mm .\nbecause  actually have several  upon the uh\nCould have one for your stereo , one for your  D_V_ player .\nMm , yeah , yeah .\nYeah , well .\nYeah .\nHave to  if we just lengthen it I guess\nYeah\nso it comes down to the base of the hand\nYeah ,\nbut that that's uh  but uh\njust kind of\nand then flatten it out\nno\nand could sit there .\nthe the the overall uh the overall concept is uh\nYeah ,  mm .\nOr just make it little .\nyeah yeah ,\nYeah .

Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand .\nNow I've um  this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um we're  we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay .

Anyway the the costings uh come in at  exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um  any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers\nMm .\nso uh um you know the  if if if the management expect us to be techno  again  fail again  technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give ,\nMm .\nso uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget .

Uh\nIf I can cut in , is it people or men ?\nPeople ,\nIs it people , okay .\nsorry .\n'Cause I thought it was only men ,\nBoth women and men ,\nso\nyeah .\n'Kay .\nOkay . Uh the findings um uh  seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly .

Uh less important is tel teletext ,\nMm-hmm .\nuh um they use it , but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh\nOkay , that's okay .\nand  but not important is the channel selection , the the   hmm ?\nThat's a little weird .\nOh ,\nWhich channel selection ?\nthe the  no no no no no , that's very important , but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings\nOkay ,\nand uh\nwe can we can hide those under a menu or something ,\nOh , okay .\nYeah .\nokay .\nUm new preferences preferences . Uh um um beep to find your control , was\nThat's like a button on your T_V_ ?\nthat was  in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control ,\nRemote , okay .\nMm .\nso uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to  let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things .\nOkay .\nAnd they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ?\nWe wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nIs that manageable ? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too .\nThat sounds too\nYeah .\nIt's possible , but uh I think it's expensive , but do continue .\nOkay .\nYeah . Um  Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so I can uh I dunno , so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh  so , the remote mu must see or um must um  see wha what mine preferences are for which channel ,\nOkay , you don't set it yourself ,\nso I can zap t to\nit just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example .\nWhat ?\nYou want the  you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f\nYeah .\nor you want it to recognise your favourite channel ?\nYeah .\nLet's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel ,\nRecognise\nso it recognises your favourite channel .\nYeah . Yeah , that's uh what my personal preference like .\nOkay , so it's it it does  it recognise itself , you don't have to set it\nNo ,\nOkay .\nitself . Maybe it's easier to  to sell it , but\nOkay .\nI don't know it's manageable , but we will uh we will see .\nI see .\nYeah , it's a little bit uh it's the end of it .\nOkay .\nIt's a little bit uh I lost it ,\nOkay .\nthe computer uh crashed ,\nNo problem , it's it's okay ,\nso .\nthat's  Yeah , go ahead .\nShall I go ? Okay .\nYeah .\nSo , some technical functions .\nDarn computer .\nBasically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . Uh let's just start with the method .\nYeah .\nIt sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . We can do that . What goes wrong  at the user . Gets the remote control . Where is the remote control ? We've all had it once , I want to watch some television ,\nYeah .\nwhere's the remote control ? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder ,\nYeah .\nThat seems very good .\na really good idea . Uh these are just the issues . I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . Searches for the button . There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear .\nMm-hmm .\nUh also symbols tend to fade after a while .\nMm uh .\nThere's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that ,\nOkay , so have it more  make it more durable actually . Okay .\nyes . Uh covered that . Oh yes , user presses the button . Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that ,\nOkay , so the buttons should be\nso we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nAnd possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger\nWow . The s Yeah . Make it  make them bigger .\nsi\nEven more durable uh .\nSo this is basically what I h had in mind in the  fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh  need to be replaced by others . Uh\nOkay .\nThis I pretty much covered .  So what we want to go to is not this one ,\nYeah , it's true .\nbut more  less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .\nYeah .\nthat's basically uh what I had in mind . So\nYeah , that's clear .\nThis is not the final design ,\nNo , of course uh\nthis is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea .\nYeah . I must say that it  Hmm .\nSo that was it .\nThat was it . Okay , that was good . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it  the durability of of the thing ,\nYeah , I think it's a really good idea .\nso\nYeah .\nThe other aspects , we'll just see how  what you came up with and what's possible for that budget .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay , that's fine . Um . Okay , now work a little with me . Okay . Well ,\nlet's start it as it is . Okay , uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? I'll tell you why that's important to me . Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's  why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .\nMm-hmm .\nSo keep in mind that everything that you keep uh  think of , it has to b to be built .\nYeah .  Of course , hmm .\nSo it's  that's not as easy as it s might look like .\nOkay .\nUh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . I have to check out how far I can go with that . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper .\nYou mean integrate them all into the circuit board . Okay .\nExactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper .\nYeah , okay .\nSo we have to  make something that's not too difficult in design again .\nSo you have\nThis is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . The switch uh uh  uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared and an interv um  uh how to say it ? Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning .\nMm-hmm .\nUh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light .\nOkay . Okay . That was it ?\nThat was it .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentations, presentation, meeting, design, powerpoint", "dialogue_id": 41}, {"text": "I'll get back to my thing then . Uh  Okay , back this up  to the screen . So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either  Well , I don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it .\nYeah .\nBut I don't think it should be  very  it should be one of the big buttons for example . Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . It's not important anymore . Um we're targeting young people now , because our um   This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people ,\nUh .\nwhich are  um the younger people were defined under forty .\nYeah .\nI so I think it's\nHmm .\nthat's also good with the fashion and everything ,\nB\nso yeah .\nYeah , and they want to pay for it\nThey want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like .\nand uh\nIf they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it .\nWith more  Where  with more technical specifications\nYeah .\nin the\nsee how far we can go with it anyway , so\nYeah .\nAnd one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently  black and yellow , but  I'm not sure if we  I think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . So  With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your\nOh .\nI mean those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover\nYeah .\nand so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . Or we can sh for example we can make a different   a basic design . And sell the covers separately , for example . That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . So you don't have to  I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately .\nMm-hmm .\nSo that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . So\nHmm .\njust  I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . Would you like to share ?\nYeah .\nNo , I think this is a good idea .\nOkay .\nBut\nBut  oh ?\nIs it manageable ? Is it easy ?\nGo ahead .\nYeah , with with an L_C_D_ screen you can\nOh yeah . I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen ,\nY Yes , I think so too .\nlike you said . I think for example it's it's huge  I think the L_C_D_ is huge ,\nYeah .\nWhy ? Nokia w\nit consumes batteries like hell .\nUh .\nI think it takes up a lot of a lot of power .\nAnd it costs too much to fabricate ,\nIt costs a lot , I think .\nso we're on a tight budget here .\nOkay , uh\nWhat we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview ,\nOkay .\nbut y I'm not sure if it's even possible  . For example , a little T_V_ guide .\nMm .\nLike you have a little\nHmm .\njust just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nso you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . I'm not sure it's even possible ,\nHmm . I have to check that out ,\nbut maybe okay , make it\nI'm not sure .\nYeah , find a little compromise in that , but  What did I write down ?\nYeah .\nI think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_\nThat must be possible .\nand just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . I think it's easy to implement ,\nJa .\nwe should go for that .\nI'm sorry ,\nUh speech recognition .\nAnd it's\nwhe where do you wanna hit the T_  you wanna   we want a button on the television .\nI thin  Yeah , I mean where else should you put it ?\nIn th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control .\nYeah ,\nBecause that's not possible uh .\nbut  how are you gonna use that if your  I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press  where are you gonna press the button ?\nUh . Yeah . Exactly .\nMaybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal .\nA slap-on sticker . Oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ .\nMm uh .\nYeah , that could be possible .\nYeah , exactly .\nA little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay .\nOkay , then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do .\nI think it's universal . I think we should go for universal ,\nIf not\nbecause apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people .\nOkay .\nI think universal remote control should be possible .\nYeah . Um\nOkay , then I go for that .\nEveryone uh wants to buy it , so we w\nYeah , I think we're targeting everyone ,\nYeah .\nso remote\nOkay . No ,\nyeah .\nit's fine with me , but then I know what to look for .\nOkay , universal is good . Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do .\nYeah . Or one .\nAnd it's\nOr when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough ,\nYeah , but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever .\nright ? But  Oh yeah .\nBesides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that  is a problem in implementing this .\nIt's  Yeah .\nYeah .\nIt's not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control ,\nOkay .\nso\nIt's a good idea , but it's just not  I don't think the market's ripe for that yet .\nI don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh .\nUh-huh .\nWhat else do we have ?\nYeah .\nUm well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . So the the the symbols won't fade ,\nMm-hmm .\nmaybe a little harder plastic\nExactly .\nor especially li we don't\nI already noted that .\nmaybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , so those always fade first .\nMm , okay . Okay .\nMm the thing is the most important things that we have now .\nHmm .\nLet's see .\nIf we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area .\nFor example ?\nThat's fo  is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language .\nWell , we're not we're not targeting older people ,\nYeah .\nwe should remember that . Everything we target is under forty ,\nThat's\nso .\nokay , okay .\nYou assume that that they read correctly and I think they're\nHuh .\nThe most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world ,\nBut b\nso\nUh okay .\nBut should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the\nNo , of course . No , I think it's just something you you put over them , because  Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well ,\nHmm .\ntha that's not a that's not a bad  that's not even\nC\nBut every\nthat's a problem with the with the text then .\nit's not even a bad idea . I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could\nHmm .\nFor example , if your buttons are faded , after  I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover .\nMm .\nUh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make .\nOkay .\nSo it's a good and a bad idea .\nUh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve ,\nMm-hmm .\nso you don't have to change your whole cover . Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve .\nOh yeah , I know what you mean .\nKnow what I mean ?\nOh .\nIt works the same as a Nokia telephone , it's it's in my uh  'kay .\nYeah , I know , it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example ,\nYeah .\nokay . Yeah ,\nYeah .\nExactly .\nthat's what I  something I have to look into . Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which which is easier ,\nHmm .\nso   Um anyway , yeah , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we  let's see we  So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . I want some  you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nbecause that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with .\nOkay .\nUm  Yeah , I think user interface is fairly obvious . I mean it should be very intuitive ,\nPretty straightforward .\ns Yeah , it should speak for itself . Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first ,\nand I'm  total T_V_ new , anyway . So I think it should be  have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second  second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um  the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a  just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ .\nMm .\nIs it techni technically possible to uh  send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu ,\nYeah .\nbecause we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ?\nThat is true .\nI don't think so .\nNo , that's true .\nNo , I don't think so . Because the television needs to respond to the signal ,\nYeah , that's true .\nIt's an in-built menu ,\nand if it doesn't know how , it's\nisn't it ? Yes .\nExactly , that's not possible .\nSo basically\nI'm not sure if it's impossible ,\nwe\nbut uh there's a chance it's not , so .\nOr we could use a double-sided  for  less used functions\nA double-sided remote control ?\nyou\nI don't think that's useful .\nYeah , with the cover .  I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues ,\nYeah , but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons .\nbecause\nFor example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a  for a Sony that won't  for a Philips T_V_ .\nHmm .\nNo , but basic functions\nYeah .\nbut functions which are not frequently used .\nI don't think we should\nBecause if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it ,\nYeah , for exam\nso\nI'm not s\nMm yeah .\nyeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that  it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings\nMm .\nthat you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing ,\nMm .\nbut you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s .\nBut that might be broken .\nI think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh\nHmm .\nbecause usually the the menu is  the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands ,\nHmm . Hmm .\nso . 'Cause everybody  I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so I think\nHmm .\nI'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . Uh I think just a b\nMm okay .\nand the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing .\nMm . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it .\nYeah . Yeah , that's true . I think so\nYeah .\nBecause otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our\nYeah . Yeah .\nuh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to .\nOkay , I thi I think so too .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay .\nAnd I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices ,\nMm-hmm .\nand you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different .\nYeah . Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else ,\nWe should not do that .\nbecause it's  either it's both  mayb\nExactly .\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nmaybe the shape can be a little different .\nI have some ideas . I have some ideas .\nMaybe it's a little more curves or whatever .\nMm that's your uh division .\nUm  yeah . And uh with different colours uh .\nSo um\nI'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have .\nYeah , this  . Not sure what\nOkay .\nbecause we have forty minutes , I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so .\nI heard a beep go .\nYeah , but it wasn't me , it was him closing something .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "buttons, button, teletext, remote, technology", "dialogue_id": 41}, {"text": "So anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . I mean what do you want , do you want  , but\nYeah , but we like some some curves or\nYeah , may maybe something like this . But though smooth inside . So you have the transmitter here for example .\nYeah .\nLet's see that you  what would be handy . I think that the  the buttons should be  the channel buttons should be  uh on their own .\nUh . And a light uh\nLet's see one , two  God damn it .\nOh , we get the general ideas , yes .\nYeah , okay .  Another one here . Let's see what  I think this should  these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here .\nHmm .\nYeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume\nThink it's like this .\nVolume .\nWithi within the  Yeah , just take it .\nyeah yeah . So you have the up channel  the down channel  the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ?\nDo you take triangles or\nUh it's it's fine , I think .\nUm I think it should be I think it\nThis is basically what people are accustomed to ,\nMaybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever .\nso\nYeah .\nYeah , but this is just a g general idea .\nOh d\nYeah .\nUh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle .\nYeah , in the middle . It's it's usually uh there , but  Mm .\nWhoa .\nPerhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you  if it's lost , for people that are deaf . They they won't hear the the beep .\nYeah .\nYeah , but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash .\nYou won't be able to find it .\nYeah .\nAnd flash takes up a lot of batteries again .\nUh . Yeah , it's true , but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost .\nJust\nYeah .\nWe could make a combination that it goes beep and that you  that some light lights up .\nSo .  deaf people ?\nAnd L_E_D_ uh on it .\nYeah , I thought about for deaf people for example , so . We could do that . Uh let's see .\nJust a light on it or\nSo we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ?\nOh yeah , it's true . Um that thing should be central .\nVery important .\nYou shouldn't be  you uh shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere .\nOh ,\nI usually press it on top .\nthat's  It's\nYeah .\nAt least that's what I'm accustomed to .\nI have another idea ,\nYeah , like that's gonna work .\nI'm not sure if it's possible .\nAnd\nWhat would you like to  ?\nYeah , I thought maybe we should move the buttons down\nBut you r\nand put it here for example\nAnd you are reading from the t\nto\nyou always read from the top to the the bottom of it .\nFrom top to bottom . Yeah , that's true ,\nYeah ,\nyou should\nso it's\nI think the bu the power button should be on top ,\nMm .\nYeah .\n'cause it's the first thing you do  , turn it on . So power button on top . Um\nOkay , mute button . Is that somewhere here ?\nMute . Do we hardly  I think it should be at the bottom somewhere .\nIs that used often ?\nSo i it's\nThe mute button ? Do people use that often ?\nsorry ?\nMute . Turn the sound off .\nNo , it's  no .\n'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it  right over here , at least in general ,\nUh . Hmm .\nbut\nI don't think it's important ,  but I think it I think it should be  you c\nIt's not that important , no .\nyou could put it somewhere here .\nOr or with the volume selection .\nNo , because it  Yeah , people are accustomed to that ,\nAround uh not uh not at top at the  around the volume selection .\nit's   Can I have that ? That's j\nSure .\nI don't know where exactly ,\nTake this out and here see\nbut\nUh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? I'm drawing triangles , but\nThat's pretty much what people are accustomed to ,\nYeah ,\naren't they ?\nit's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . So anyway , I think this is  should be the channels and  or sh\nWell ,\nWha\nI'm accustomed to the channels being on top .\nNo . Yeah .\nHere ,\nYeah , me too .\nokay . Okay ,\nYeah , that's better .\nshould we chan\nOn the right .\nokay ,  this two , channel up and down .\nShall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every\nWell ,\nYeah .\nfor  that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it\nMaybe it's more ex expensive .\nMm , yeah .\nMaybe we should  what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example .\nUh .\nYou have  just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying .\nBut isn't that expensive in the entire package ?\nBut that's already possible .\nYeah .\nI'm not sure y  I'm not sure it's  if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . Because if  it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable ,\nbut at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour .\nYes . Yes . Okay . Uh you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable ,\nI think I have a nice idea .\nbut it  you're  the remote also can act as a recharger . So then you can choose , you have every decision . Know what I mean ?\nNot exactly uh .\nYou can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire .\nHmm . Yeah yeah .\nI think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a  maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it .\nSo  but\nYeah , that's g\nBut I think that will cost a lot .\nI'm not sure .\nUh a normal wire would be better .\nA what ?\nLike a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself ,\nWell , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal\nyou don't need basic station . Yes .\nor  So you could put that on a T_V_ for example .\nThat is possible , that's true .\nIt could be very flat , could be very small .\nBut  Which\nIt's a very small  Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but  So you can put your remote on flat for example .\nMm .\nAnd at the backside of remote just just just a little hole\nYeah .\nYeah .\nfor example um you just  put it down , it recharges for example .\nYeah .\nI don't think it's very expensive .\nBut again , isn't that too expensive ?\nYeah .\n'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station\nI'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that's what he r\nMm .\nThat's that you  that's what you buy yourself .\nYes . I'm going to try to find that out . I'm not sure if there's information available on this ,\nIt's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible .\nbut\nBut\nAnd do people actually want that ? To pay extra  they want to pay for rechargeable ?\nYeah , they want to pay for it .\nDo they want  but they want a rechargeable one ?\nYeah .\nI'm not sure , you should find out if it's  if rechargeable is important .\nTh uh there was not a el ask esque\nYeah .\nHmm . These are uh comfort issues . So I think people will pay  they wanted to pay for comfort .\nBut\nThey want to pay for comfort ,\nWell , this is comfort .\nwe just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it ,\nBut f hmm .\nYes .\num and  Yeah , we have to  either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .\nHmm . Yeah . Exactly . I think this is a brilliant product .\nI think it would be good actually .\nI would buy it myself .\nI like the beep part  anyway .\nUh .\nSo um\nlet's go through the\nI like the covers . That's a brilliant idea .\nCan can we save this or\nCovers is covers is good .\nI never thought\nYeah , it's  Oh we can save this . Up and saved . We even saved the ant .  Um   Okay . So\nwhat we have is  you have  I think you have  to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost .\nI hope if I have information about that ,\nMaybe  yeah ,\nI'm gonna\nor  maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWe are going for twenty five Euros sales price ,\nYeah , okay .\nbut just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers ,\nYeah yeah yeah .\nMm .

Mm .\nnot uh  they want to\nYeah , so we don't want  we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot .\nNo\nMm .\nIt's  yeah , it's easy to learn\nYes , but it should cover all the functions ,\nwi and uh\nWell\nso possibly , just an idea that popped in\nwhat  we had function that what people do ,\nUm\nso . People change channels , people   they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . That's the basic fu that's what you do  I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented .\nYeah , but we could go a step further ,\nAnd  The  If\nbecause some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .\nThat's true , but that's what we stick under the menu button . Everything is  you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu .\nYes , but it  Because we're making\nBut that's the question , is it ?\nUm\nBecause it needs to be configured in the television under the menu .\nYeah , but\nIf it isn't , then we cannot reach it .\nWe need to adjust to the  technology .\nBut I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu .\nI think so too . I think so too .\nTrue .\nUh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? If you rule out functions , then uh  and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it .\nNo , I thi\nThen the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it .

Hmm , okay ?\nYeah , that's true .\nSo uh\nwe can\nSpeech recognition is quite\nWe can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh\nYeah , just look at the possibilities then ,\nI dunno .\nbecause if\nYeah .\napparently it's what people want ,\nHmm .\nit's supposed to be a luxurious remote ,\nHow much it will cost\nUh .\nand\nmaybe it's not even that expensive . Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or  for some extra information on it , on your programmes .\nUh I\nWell\nUm\nI doubt it , but\nBut I really need finance information .\nMe too .  I mean we all do .\nIt will come uh\nWe all do .\nRight . I think it's something we should put into consideration . Apparently it's what people want , so . We should see if  what it costs , if it's possible .\nMm . Uh .\nYeah .\nYeah .  Yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . Even if you put it  even if you put a different cover on it , it looks  still looks boring ,\nDifferent colours maybe .\nso .\nHmm . And the design , it should differ .\nBut all\nThis is Philips , huh ?\nI have no clue .\nPhilips has this .\nI just drew something what  which would fit into your hand easily .\nWell , I had basically\nOkay . Hmm . Uh .\nSomething like this . To make it kind of futuristic .\nMm . Oh , I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker ,\nI think it's a very\nbecause I need to put all the electronics in it .\nSorry ?\nIf we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker ,\nYeah ?\nbecause I have to put all the electronics in it .\nOkay . Mm-hmm . Yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy .\nOkay .\nI mean we can stick it in in there , I think .\nNo .\nHuh even if\nSo\nin the worst case we can even\nwhat kind of\nCould you give me the pen back ?\nYeah , sure .\nSo let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . Let's take take the basic design again , what we  oh , crap  uh came up with . I'll just make it a little bigger now . So a transmitter here . Anyway . We could  let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . So then we should probably put it here .\nIt doesn't have to be really big , but just just have to be  has to be there .\nHmm .\nThink it's a good place , people don't\nIf you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top .\nNo ? It's not that uh  it's not the most important function ,\nMe too .\nIt's j\nit's just an extra thing ,\nAh\nit just  you press the buttons on top ,\nUh . But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it ,  I think it's very important to use it ,\nbut  .\nbecause your finger is on top .\nuh because it's   use it uh\nHow can you use an L_C_D_ screen ?\nBut nee the function of it .  So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot  it costs a lot .\nYeah , but why\nSo\nI  I'm not sure .\nNow it's pretty much tucked away in your hand .\nUh if you t if you press a button , you can see it ,\nHmm . No .\nri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like .\nI'm\nM I personally would prefer it on the top .\nYou would prefer it n Okay .\nYeah .\nSo we have three people saying it should be on top .\nHuh .\nOkay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else .\nBut it  Hmm .\nAnyways .\nIt's expensive to build it ,\nMm .\nso\nUh this looks a little\nI'm still not convinced of the\nyou must use the maximum of it .\nAbout the L_C_D_s thing .\nYeah .\nWell if it if it's\nHmm .\nif it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it ,\nThey want it uh .\nbecause it's it's cool .\nWe should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information .\nHuh . Uh . But uh\nAlso keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space . So I have to look if that's possible .\nYeah , I know uh .\nSo basically\nBut if we\ncan I\nUh we have green now uh\nwhat we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ?\nOr maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit  that has it on on on the bottom .\nIn middle of it . In the middle .\nMaybe in a circle for example , like we  like in this example . I think this is not good , but for  we could make circular buttons for example . For up and down , ma make it a circle on it ,\nHmm .\nYes , but we do agree that we  keep this at the centre ,\nbecause it\nYeah .\nbecause it's basically the most important function .\nI think the channel button should be in the centre .\nIt's the most import yeah .\nChannel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . Because it's uh\nWell , that would make them quite small .\nWe're not sure about the size anyway ,\nSo maybe you'd put them here .\njust a general design . You can make it as big as you want . For example if you take uh\nYes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like .\nNo ,\nHmm .\nlet's see . For example just\nIf we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two .\nYeah .\n.\nI don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely .\nThat might be an option . Yeah , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need .\nYeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is .\nBut it has to be a little bit heavier .\nThe L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big .\nOkay .\nNo , but the things behind it .  space .\nMm let's see .\nLike a process uh .\nFinish meeting now .\nFinish meeting now .\nIt's on your computer .\nOkay , we will . So either\nSo would we like this or would we like the\nWe either we have to decide what what people want .\nI like this one more .\nEither this one , this this could be the luxurious one . So we have channel buttons here . I'm just drawing something uh . Uh  I think this would this would look cool . You could have it for example  small buttons here for some extra functions ,\nUh .\nso if your basic function's here , we should  like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here .\nLet's see what we have here .\nMm .\nOr  And uh what about speech recognition uh\nWell you can just  no , I'm not sure if we can do that ,\nYeah , yeah ,\nbut we could put a microphone in here for example .\nbut  or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech .\nMm .\nI think it's  L_C_D_ is better now .\nJust to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "documents, emails, draft, powerpoint, presentation", "dialogue_id": 41}, {"text": "Yeah .\nI'll try to .\nBut let's cut the meeting for now yes .\nYeah .\nOne more uh thing I'd like to say , uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars .\nOkay .\nYeah , okay , yeah ,\nShall we all try uh to think about a name ?\nSo I think of a name .\nthat's\nYeah , let's think of a name , okay .\nyeah , that's okay .\nUh okay .\nOh , good .\nOkay , at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly ,\nSo\nso there we go uh .\nYes , go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch .\nYeah .\nGood luck .\nYeah , to all .\nYeah .\nSame .\nYeah , I've  Do we uh save the  ?\n.  .", "topic_id": 4, "keywords": "meeting, minutes, lunch, save, shortly", "dialogue_id": 41}, {"text": "Hi .\nHi .\nHello .\nOh .\nGood morning .\nGood morning .\nMorning .\nGood morning .\nUh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in , uh because we're uh being watched by uh Big Brother .

So they can see our faces .\nOkay .\nWelcome at the kick-off meeting . My name is uh Danny Wolfs .  Uh this is the agenda for today . Uh first a little opening . Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . So uh we get to know each other . Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . Then the project plan . What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end .  Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . I'm the Project Manager . What's your name ?\nI'm Juergen Toffs . I'm the User Interface Designer .\nUser interface , okay .\nHi , my name's uh  . I'm the Industrial Designer .\nIndustrial , yes .\nI'm uh Tim  . Um my function is the Marketing Expert .\nOkay , thank you . First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh  Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ?  And that's uh really global . Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of  If it's uh it's possible technical-wise .\nUh each stage is uh  uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . So it's uh it's very straightforward .  Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards .  This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme .  This is called a smart board\nSpeaks for itself .\nthing uh  Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder .  Uh  This uh is  very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all ,\nbecause I think you know uh how it works . Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . We we may not delete anything . So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . Never delete it . That's a very important uh thing .\nOkay . Uh little uh little  kinda exercise to uh know each other .\nAt uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal ,\nand uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . Uh important is that we use different colours ,  and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths .\nI have a question .\nYes ?\nUm this exercise , um did the company board tell you to do it ,\nYeah .\nor uh did you just make it up yourself ?\nNo no no . It's uh it's uh   I I I must do it .\nIt's part of the introduction ,\nYeah , yeah , yeah . 'Cause we uh really don't know each other ,\nokay .\nand uh it's kinda new . So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff .\nOkay .\nThat kind of thing . Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal ?\nUm , yeah . I don't know really how it works . But maybe you can show us first ?\nOkay , okay . Yeah , okay . Drawing goes with uh this thing . Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . That's uh important .\nSo hold it uh like this .\nYou g you get electrocuted or\nYeah , kinda .\nSo ,  um  You must p p uh push a little uh  Good . Because  And uh wait uh wait a few seconds . It's not uh fully real-time , so uh watch it .\nAch .\nOh yeah . Well I'm gonna paint in the red .\nOh .\nOoph .\nThat's the background colour .\nWell , undo . Um  The pen ? No . One minute please .\nYeah , that's the one . Well , five . Okay .\nMy favourite animal huh ?\nIt's like Pictionary ?\nYeah , you can guess what it is .\nThe the one who says it first  gets a raise .\nMay uh paint uh next .\nIt's a pork ?\nNo , it's not an orc .\nYou don't see it uh at the ears ?\nMm yeah , I have it at home .\nYou have an orc at home ?\nVery artistic .\nThank you .\nSo it's a cat .\nWhat's it called ?\nSimba . 'Cause uh we have a cat at home\nAh .\nand he's called Simba . 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King .\nOkay .\nMiniature size ?\nSo we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion .\nOkay .\nHe's happy with us , so uh he's smiling .\nWow . He does have body uh   Huh .\nNo , only the face . Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . So we uh\nOkay . We have to speed up .\nYeah .\nRemember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths .\nYeah . Okay , who wants to go next ?\nI  Okay .\nYeah ?\nSo choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a\nYou don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing .\nSave it .\nYeah .\nOr\nYou have to save it .\nSave it , okay .\nI've done it . New ? 'Kay .\nYou have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh\nMm uh  Not really .\nKind of firm touch .\nThat one .\nOh . Uh hmm .\nYeah ? Okay . Open . Which one is it ? Smart board ?\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay . And now ? Okay . Okay , thanks . 'Kay , I've speed up . 'Kay , that's fine . Line width .\nBy the way , why was your cat uh red ?\nBecause uh my cat is red uh at home .\nOh .\nOh , okay .\nAnd I have red hair , so uh must be red .\nIt's a very bloody cat .\nOh , yeah , sure .\nIt's a frog .\nNo , it's a turtle .\nUh it's an apple .\nIt's not an apple .\nMust be a dog .\nA dog ?\nYeah .\nHmm . Colour .  Something like this . Smaller .\nHuh ?\nOh , it is a turtle .\nIt is a turtle . Why a turtle ? Why ? Tim ?\nUm  'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles .\nYou watched it a lot ?\nUh ?\nYou watched it a lot ?\nIt's uh inside its shell . You'll be uh finished sooner .\nNo , it's uh\nIt's a scared turtle .\nNo no .  It's coming up . Mm . Uh .\nWow .\nOkay , Tim . Thank you .\nSomething like this .  Okay , you know\nVery artistic .\nJurgen , you want to go next ?\nYes  . Okay . Wha Thank you .\nYeah ? Here you go .\nYeah . Um\nHow did it work ?\nFormat ? And then you have the the current colour ,\nPerformance ?\nyou can change . So no red or green .\nAnd a pen ?\nAnd uh line uh width . I had five .\nTim had  Uh Tim , what kinda line width did you have ?\nUm\nUh the big lines were like nine .\nOkay . It's a dog .\nWell , very good .  I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one .\nUh .\nOkay . Why a dog ? You have a dog at home ?\nWell , we had a dog , a few years ago .\nHad a dog ?\nUh , it's p\nYeah ?\nAnd and it ,  yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something .\nAh .\nBut uh\nIt's pretty good uh\nYou have an artistic uh inner middle .\nAn artist .\nUh a Graphical User Designer , so\nHmm .\nHey .\nThink you uh picked the wrong uh function . Wrong job .\nOh .\nNo . Can work together . Ah colour .\nSo I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use . Not difficult at all .\nWha\nWell ,\nOkay ,\nit's okay  .\nthank you .\nThat's enough ,\nthanks .\nJanus ? The last one ?\nYeah , sure .\nYeah .\nUh thanks .\nI wonder .\nYeah . After a cat , a turtle and a dog .\nI think he's gonna draw an elephant .\nI figure I should do something like that ,\nbut I'm gonna do something much more difficult .\nUh-oh .\nUh-oh . Oh , he is the artistic  design .\nI'm gonna design a remote uh  remote control animal .\nRemote control animal .\nExactly . Uh\nOh .\nSorry .\nWell with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh .\nYeah .\nThat that might be easier . But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and\nNo .\nI think it's easier to draw .\nBetter to draw with a with\nYeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse .\nThan on the , with\nYeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . And then displaying on screen , but\nMouth . Oh , okay . Yeah . W with this paper it's too mu too expensive .\nBut what is he uh ?\nToo expensive , yeah .\nIs it a rabbit ?\nYes .\nDo you have a rabbit at home ?\nNo .\nIt's a rabbit with uh broken legs ?\nA green rabbit .\nNo .\nIs it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix .\nYeah , exactly .\nOkay , then yeah .\nThere , the g white green rabbit .\nSo .\nHe's a little bit stoned there .\nUh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit .\nYeah . It will do .\nUh uh  Uh well .\nOkay . Finishing touch and then we're going further .\nProject Manager ? Uh\nYeah ?\nWhere does the pen go ? Just uh\nHave you been uh counting the time ?\nYeah , a little .\nOkay . Let's go on then .\nWell , I think the dog is the the most uh artistic .\nUh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive .\nDon't choose for youself .\nOh , sorry .\nThat's selfish .

What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table .  Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ?\nUm well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh\nOkay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and  Or just only\nYeah . I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ?\nIf you have them on uh  I can uh\nYeah . Yeah , I can find  Uh .\nOkay . Oh , in case you want it  This is a dead kind of fly .

Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there .\nOh , only in Word ,\nYeah .\nokay .\nOkay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view .\nYeah .\nUm just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um\nYeah . Okay . Five minutes .\nFive minutes ?\nYeah .\nOkay , I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose .\nYeah .\nUh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose .\nYeah .\nAnd uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products .\nMm-hmm .\nUm maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um  think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .\nOkay . Okay .\nThat might be a little bit uh expensive . Um  And something like an L_C_D_ screen .\nFor what purpose ?\nUm uh like I said here um  Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um ,  when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or\nOkay . So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh\nFrom my point of view , yeah .\nremote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ?\nYeah , it has to be uh  Yeah , our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things .\nYeah . So yeah , I I agree with you .\nWe\nSo i i i i\nSo we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to\nTo the current market .\nYeah .\nLook ,  you got some cheap uh remote controls there . They just uh  Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em .\nNo .\nBut when you enter a new market with a remote control and\nMm-hmm .\nuh wanna gain market share\nYeah .\nyou have to do something special , I think .\nYeah .

Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's  I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have .

I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting  Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ?

I'm afraid I incorporated  that when I said who was present , but  yes , we did ,\nOkay .\nand we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures ,\nOkay , I accept the minutes .\nbut I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . So um as a group I think we've  are  they're accepting the minutes . And uh  okay .\nIs that what we're supposed to say ?\nYeah .\nYeah , I do .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, presentations, minutes, presentation, design", "dialogue_id": 43}, {"text": "Good . Um , then we'll move to the three presentations . Okay ?\nOkay .\nOkay . Mm we need to move this . Who wants to go f first ?  That's as far as it goes .\nUh not really meant to touch those microphones . Oh it doesn't have any on , does it ? That's fine .\nExcellent , thank you .\nOy , big loop under the table .\nShe said we didn't need to screw it in .\nOkay . Okay , that looks good .\nIt's doing its thing . There we are .\nAlright . Thank you very much . Um . One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar  of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players  although it makes immediate sense to  have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh  will only benefit from the positive feedback  from our well designed tool . So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . Um  fifty percent  I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this  there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .\nCould  can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've\nUm it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money .\nNow in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be\nMm-hmm .\num that teletext is outdated um\nMm-hmm .\nand the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .\nMm-hmm .  Well I think we can  I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't um advertise  for the I go everywhere line .\nMm .\nSo an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . So these market research uh uh questionnaires  looked into your your uh concern about technology\nHmm .\nand s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition .\nOkay .\nNow the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them  would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if  and you know , the the designers ,\nMm .\nbut ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five\nIs that a large enough target market to target it ?\nWell , I I I think  especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh\nIn real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?\nYeah . To   Um yes .\nOr eight million .\nYes . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an\nHmm .\nthat's a that's a very good question .\nYeah .\nUm\nI don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included ,\nMm .\nbut I think it's an interesting  I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology .\nMm .\nUh it definitely needs uh a lot more research\nShall I go back ?\non like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples ,\nYeah , yeah .\nand what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing .\nYeah .\nHow d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ?\nExactly . I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something  uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray .\nSh surely he's in the wrong age group .\nYou know ,\nit's  I a and I think , you know\nHe must be w one of a s small population .\nNo , no ,\nMm .\nyou  Kate , you're exactly right there .  But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be\nBut we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen ,\nUh , mm .\nthat's looking at age groups .\nExactly . I  yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar  younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . Or comfortable ,\nLeap .  Hmm . Mm .\nyou know , um so\nOkay , you had the other power channel .\nI think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers .  And this is this is also supported by the market research .\nOkay .\nThank you . That's my contribution .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remotes, presentations, remote, controls, handheld", "dialogue_id": 43}, {"text": "Alright . And we'll turn to the next presentation . I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in . And then press , what ? F F_N_ and F_ eight . Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top .\nYeah , press them .\nAnd then w be patient .\nYeah , here we go .\nTada .\nAnd if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there .\nCan I not just uh do each one in order ?\nI you can if you like , it it  that that just sets it up to do a p a p\nThere we are . Yay .\nThat ?\nno that one , that one there .\nThat ?\nLeft , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep .\nThat ? Right , technical functions design . Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss .\nOkay .\nUm and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control .\nT_V_ only .\nSo these are two models of existing remote controls . Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control .\nUgh .\nIt has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has  seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control\nHmm .\nwhere you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has  it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access  it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .\nMm . And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us .\nSo it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just  want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons\nOkay .\no I was thinking something  some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access .\nAlright .\nUh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility .\nOkay . Any uh thing else you wanna add ?\nNo .\nOkay .\nBut we could go back to the pictures of the  uh , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them ,\nOr if\nbut  maybe should hear what Kate has to say first .\nYeah .\nYeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say .\nOkay then .\nMaybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that  your  the one on the right as a as a basis .\nHmm .\nWhiteboard session .\nI think the white  that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered ,\nMm-hmm .\nDefinitely less cluttered and  I mean but still it's\nIt's there\nSorry\nbut it's\nI was just  I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say .\nThe the style of these is terrible .\nYeah .\nI I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised .\nThe ergonomics , the way it fits in your\nHmm .\nYeah .\nBut\nSo that's that for now .\nCheers . Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen .\nOkay .\nStill , I'll do without that . Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .  Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research ,  and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared .  And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and  which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the  which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . Now I would have hoped  I think that's my only slide actually , yeah . I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard .  So we want an energy source which is there . And we've got to think about what that might be .\nHmm-mm .\nUh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions .  Um and then we have the the user interface . Oops . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty .  Thank you .\nHmm .  Okay . Right . But those things  as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of  what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? Uh what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own .\nMm-hmm .\nThe technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? Um is there any um  because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ?\nWell I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . We're trying to sell four million of 'em ,\nMm .\num that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing ,\nOkay .\nyou just  if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need  gonna need to hit .\nOkay .\nWhoop .\nDo we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ?\nIsn't that your job ?\nBecause then\nOh .\nNo ,\nOh right .\nthe chip composer marketing . Oh no , the chip composer sender .\nMm . What they cost .\nUm , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna  give me some advice on that , if you're asking me ,\nI I don't believe I know , um .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nbut\nBe because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea .\nYeah .\nMm .\nYeah .\nIt does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the  which is pretty much the same as these existing models ,\nMm-hmm .\njust maybe a little bit more inspired ,\nInspired ?\nbut basically just the same .\nMm .\nAlthough what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nYou could  you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries ,\nWell\nwhich are\nthat has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you  then it has a place .\nMm .\nYou'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah .\nYeah , but it also has a place ,\nAnd it's not stuck down the back of the sofa .\nso  exactly .\nMm .\nBut then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not .\nThat's a really good idea .\nWell I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost .  I'll do some research for the next meeting .\nOkay .\nWell it's better than my idea about solar , probably .\nUh yeah .\nWell solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night ,\nYeah , yeah .\nbut\nMm .\nWell it is just so annoying how\nDepen\nIt would have to sor store up the energy\nMm . Yeah .\nYeah , I guess .\nand then use it . Solar can do that .\nWe may be talking quite heavy then .\nM yeah , that would be too heavy\nYeah .\nand it'd cost too much .\nMm-hmm .\nNo , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably  I mean it might cost more to  at first to develop and to install ,\nMm-hmm\nbut for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer\nMm-hmm .\nand\nSo do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ?\nyou know f\nDefinitely ,\nMm .\n'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh  the  loss and breakage of um remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live ,\nMm .\nMm .\nSort of have its little dock that you could put it in .\nexactly .\nYeah .\nSo if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is\nAnd the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent .\nExactly .\nStill I don't know if it's quite within our price range .\nHmm .\nMm . 'Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware .\nYeah .\nYeah .

Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end .\nWell I I brought up some  exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ?\nMm .\nMm .\nYeah ,\nYou know ,\nI was wondering that ,\nthese are the\nbecause I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy  something new ,\nI I s usually put more money than brains .\nYeah , exactly .\nbut   Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that ,\nOh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . Good , good comment .\nare they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range ,\nYeah .\nI don't know .\nYeah .\nIt might be good to know um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home ?\nMm . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead .\nYeah .\nMm . Yeah .\nYeah .\nOr do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it .\nRight , good point . Yeah , yeah okay , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah , good point .\nThat's probably more what it is .\nYeah .\nWhat would be a more efficient way of doing it ?\nYeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers .\nMm-hmm . Okay . Right .\nWe're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day ,\nProbably not .\nare we ?\nMm .\nUm the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n  definitely we wanna be inspired that the current  styles are just plain awful .\nYeah .\nDo we need  um let me\nIs that agreeable to everyone ?\nBr actually , um\nMm-hmm .\nthe enter key  I have a chart here that I didn't include . Um\nMm-hmm .\nDo you want the gizmo ?\nyeah , which might\nThrow some light on that .\nTh yeah , th those are   felt like had a lot of charts .\nUm actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing .\nOkay , I I  my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only  just really in terms of streamlining .\nAh . Mm-hmm . Okay . Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key .\nUm   Exactly . Again , you know ,\nIs that okay with you ?\nthinking of menus or\nSorry ,\nWould that\nH how does that work ?\nI was miles away .\nHow  so so how does that work ,\nI was re I was reading the chart to be honest .\nUm well\nuh-huh .\nhow do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ?\nif you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um\nThen you'd have to have an off te off key .\nso you press power after you've um  well I was thinking maybe you  to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession ,\nOkay , yep , mm-hmm .\nMm .\nand maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice .\nIt's not getting a bit complicated ? Could granny do this ,\nWell\nor are we just not aiming at granny ?\nOr y yeah . Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off .\nWho's got an iPod then ?\nYeah ,\nMm . Okay .\nI don't  um I wish . Anyway , uh  that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important .\nMm .\nIt's definitely channel , volume , power .\nYeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself ,\nExactly .\nlike here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself .\nExactly .\nI I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control ,\nYeah .\nso um I would say that they are definitely less relevant .\nOkay .

Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have  the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . Um and we should each have a presentation to make . Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three ,  um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . Okay .  Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . Right um as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting  the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of  going after  going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for  be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um  the corporate image . So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .  Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYes .\nOkay . Right . So we're ready to close that and go back to our  That one . Right .

But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market .\nMm 'kay .\nBut I'm going to move on to more interesting um  more vibrant things .  So , I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my uh  the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch .\nAnd\n'Kay .\nSorry .\nI'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on   .\nI know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research ,\nso you know , I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . What's hot , fruit and veg . Spongy .\nAnd this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes .\nThis is really interesting change from past years ,\nMm .\nbecause it is much more organic , um some would say approachable .  And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . So .  I also did a little research on um  what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . Fancy . Functional is out . And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant ,  you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically  superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . Ease of use . Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of  fruit  fruit themed sleeves .\nI think that's a good idea . Don't you ?\nY yeah , you know\nIt sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .\nYes .\nExactly .  Exactly . I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress .  you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .\nMm .\nThey could be  ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . Um it could actually  the sleeve could  take up a lot of the  development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it .\nThey could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . So what we're talking about is changing . this concept . Everyone has a T_V_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit .\nThat's what's hot on the catwalks .  So , this is my  This is what I'm thinking .\nHmm .\nUh-huh mm . In most families , don't  isn't the remote  is a remote .\nY yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it  we all need a remote ,\nMm .\nbut the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the  someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .\nSo when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this .\nYeah . W and  plus I think\nMm . Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s\nUh yeah .\nand they would have a remote for each one ,\nYeah .\nso .\nYeah . So this is an idea and I I  you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This  spongy fruit and veg .\nYeah , I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .\nThanks .  Alright .\nHmm .\nSpongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid .\nYep .  And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components .\nHmm .\nI I just have my ear to the market , guys .\nIs this  to the market  ?\nYeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,\nIs spongiest , yeah .\nyeah .\nThat would add\nI was thinking titanium myself .\nI was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just  I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they're also minimalist and shiny .\nMm-hmm .  They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . I think many of us would associate those with fancy . Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . We could call it uh   The name .\nAre we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ?\nWell it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So\nPerhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management\nYeah , but it's kind of pointless , isn't it ?\nand perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product .\nYeah .\nThat , you know , that might be\nLet's delegate .\nWo would that be agreeable ?\nAnd then we could keep it titanium .\nYeah .  W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um  maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do .\nYeah , maybe . Or\nDo you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ?\nI think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .\nOkay , we'll move the\nUm\nYou can even have them in different flavours as well .  So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour ,\nYeah . Or s or smelly . Scratchy\nyeah . Scratch and sniff .\nUh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone .\nRight , well\nIt's hot on the streets , guys .\nI I I think some of this um", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "marketing, cost, market, branding, innovative", "dialogue_id": 44}, {"text": "you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world .  So um I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um . Now this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . I really need a pen or something but uh  does my mouse work ? No . Um  oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ?\nMm .\nRight . This is this is the a a  a remote that's been opened up\nMm .\nand that's the the back of the interface . And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . Um  and we  that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um  uh the the points that you made , Sarah , but um  doing my presentation in the order I wrote it .  So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source .\nUm we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . We can have a hand   sorry\nA wind-up .\na wind-up , yeah ,  which I think is quite an interesting concept for a   sorry  for a remote control ,\nbut i it maybe is  doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg .\nAlright .\nUm one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source ,\nRemember , we only have forty minutes\nwhere um  you you actually get the energy by moving the device ,\nMm .\nHmm .\nwhich is quite a ni a nice and neat one . You have to  it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work .\nOr we we had talked about solar power ,\nHmm .\nbut I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark .\nMm .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "mouse, buttons, button, remote, devices", "dialogue_id": 44}, {"text": "Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like ,  or titanium .\nHmm .\nUm and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um  I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium ,\nHmm .\nand basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .\nHmm .\nOkay , what does the interface look like ? Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with .  Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push ,\nHmm .\nso you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something .  Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it  the technology is there . And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost .   Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it  that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . Now I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology .\nMm .\nAnd  well I I think we've got two options . We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which  means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um that  may or may not be a good thing .\nSorry .  Um  but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker .  So , thank you .\nThat sounds good . Any idea   you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference .\nYeah ,\nUm do you have any idea if if this could  if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ?\nI'm afraid I don't have that information available . Um manufacturing didn't actually give  attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid .\nHmm .\nHmm . Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . But I think the important thing might be to choose one .\nYeah mm-hmm .\nYou know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry .\nBear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company ,\nThat's uh\nso what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .\nBanana ?\nAlright , well let's see then .\nBut um I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company .\nYeah .\nIt's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .\nYeah . But  yeah ,\nWe we could we could do um a double curved rubber one ,\nI'm trying to streamline mine a little bit .\nwhich would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface ,\nYeah .\nwe can't do anything fancier .\nShall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what  well ,  my extensive presentation  on what sort of interfaces are available .\nHmm .\nYeah .\nYep .\nMm . Thank you , Kate .\nThank you , Kate .\nMm .\nYou did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . So  so mine's a bit pointless . Right .\nF_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ?\nYes . There we go .\nI don't have it on mine though .\nOh I think um Florence resolved it by\nI If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again , it's  it'll\nDo it again .\nF_ eight again .\nKeep doing it until you get it in both  you get it there , you get it yours without that one ,\nI think it  yeah , you you will do an\nand then you get it with both .\nShould I do it again ?\nYeah .\nMaybe .\nThis time it should come up both .\nRight then . I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says ,\nOkay .\njust that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things .\nMm-hmm . Mm .\nUh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece .  Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , which  Well , I couldn't find a  the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse .\nHmm .\nHmm .\nSo I was thinking that uh  um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do  you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up\nand you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,\nMm .\num which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . So\nwhat seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know ,  just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive .\nMm .\nHmm .\nAnd when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching .\nYeah .\nAnd so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down .\nYeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "buttons, remotes, mouse, controls, interface", "dialogue_id": 44}, {"text": "And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic .\nIt's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .\nYeah . Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .\nHmm .\nUh  then\nAnd the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 'cause um  otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting  building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well .\nAnd it's a little bit pointless as well I think .\nThere is that .\nLike when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy ,\nIt's a duplication .\njust a little menu showing  yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment .\nMm-hmm .\nI don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer .  Um . But as for actually arranging them  let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right .\nMm-hmm .\nDo you want scroll buttons in that as well ?\nI I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a   I can't quite d uh describe it .  you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . Yeah , see where the mouse is ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle ,\nRight .\nso you pick your menu and then  your different options and when when you click on each one , it  you can go into a new menu for that . I'm getting a bit uh specific here .\nReally we'd have to use something to show you ,\nYeah . I think I think that's a g nice clean design ,\nbut\nit's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology .\nTo uh m make it .\nIf  I don't think I can get it up on the screen . Ah here we go . Right .\nOh nice .\nWell ,\nUm  Hmm .\nthe iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated .\nHuh .\nYeah .\nIt does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . What else have we got ?\nMm . Wow .\nThem , they're terrible . But they all have this this feature of this uh  It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle ,\nIt's a selection wheel .\nwhich I think is a really good idea .\nBut we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .\nYeah , like up , down , left and right . Which is good . And then and then  Yeah , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down ,  uh and then also  when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down .\nOkay .\nSo all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .\nOkay .\nAnd that's it .\nIn fact\nLook at look at this one .\nOh that's really nice .\nAlmost impossible to misplace or l or lose .\nDo you think with um\nMight take up your whole living room .\nIt seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the  something reminiscent of the child's remote . Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . You know ,\nPossibly .\nwe could call  like a fruit name ,\nHmm .\nYeah .\nbut it would be a little more abstract .\nMm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather  if you feel  if you like the spongy\nThat also is possible .\nMm-hmm .\nJust\nI'm just just throwing out ideas .\nOr call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow .\nHmm .\nYeah . I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so\nOkay .\nYeah .\nUh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? This is actually the volume up and down ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut  they both say V_ on them ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhich , when you first look at it ,  you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nbut it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .\nMm-hmm .\nHmm .\nYeah .\nNice . Good point .\nBut we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .\nMm 'kay .\nBut then , that's complicated .\nI wanna thank you all for all your presentations . We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . So  let's  Mm . Right . They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which  the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point .\nThe  You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ .\nMm .\nUm so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ?\nOh unfortunately I don't have costing information .\nOkay .\nI i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic ,\nMm 'kay .\nbut I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost .\nWhat's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ?\nI've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy , you don't even notice um that it's there .\nIt sounds great . I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . Sounds like it could be g a really good economical\nIt's\nit would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient .\nMm-hmm .\nHmm .\nIt could tie in with the fanciful design\nHmm .\nYeah .\nas uh , you know ,\n'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought ,\nthrow the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving .\nisn't it ? It's like  yeah ,\nSo the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible .\na good selling point .\nBe\nBut it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .\nIt costs .  Mm .\nAnd and how much you do have to keep it moving ,\nYeah .\nMm .\n'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity .\nYeah . Mm-hmm .\nMm .\nBut I could market that as a um as a  a  I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know .\nDo your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nTrue , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly .\nYeah , that's what I was thinking as well .\nMm-hmm . You know ,\nYeah .\nkind of the\nThanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks .\nOh right , okay ,\nUm  the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision .\nI'd  that that's something I maybe should have covered . Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique\nOh .\num and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative .\nOkay .\nWhat about the ca\nI i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built\nyeah . Oh , the way we  uh-huh .\nand you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper .\nOh , okay . Um what about the case ? I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber ,\nand I think we've discussed not having titanium . One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . Um we've sort of eliminated wood . We said plastic or rubber . What's the pleasure ?\nWell if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's\nThat's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold .\nyeah .\nWhat about you ?\nDo you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover ,\nMm . Kind of like an internal egg .\nCover .\nso it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it .\nPlastic inside .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nBecause I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac\nI'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh  sounds like a nice idea if it is .\nYeah . Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them ,\nHmm .\nAnd with sports on television .\nOkay .\nand\nYou know .\nUm the next part they want is the user interface concept .\nI should I should r\nI su\nI'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to  finish with .\nThen I'll just say I support either  from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that .\nOkay , and it says interface . What type and what supplements ?\nJust copy the one on the left .  No um a scroll  Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen .\nWhich I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that\nYeah ,\nthat brings the cost down quite a lot\nI'd  like push buttons with\nand it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on .\nSo push buttons\nOkay , um  that's that . Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Whew .\nAnd they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . Marketing they want product evaluation .\nNo , it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually .\nNo we can't , actually .\nOh . Oh my , I'm sorry .\nThat's why I was looking over your shoulder\nOh , okay . Sorry about that . missed that one . This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . Ah , ta-da .\nNow it's gone again .\nAh .\nYou know , I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately .\nYes , because I can't even see mine . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes ,\nOh yes .\nthese are  the individual actions . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate ,\nMm .\nuh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product  evaluation . Um the two of you  get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype .\nGreat .\nUh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way .\nSounds good .\nAnything else we need to do ?\nI don't think so .\nGo to it .\nPlay-Doh .\nAnd that's the end of this meeting .

Um and what do I like about him , um  That's just to suggest that his tail wags .\nUm he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um  uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can  doesn't take up too much space .\nUm and uh  And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well ,\nwhich is quite amusing , so\nIs he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?\nIt is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner\nand um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .\nIt's an after dinner dog then .\nHmm .\nYeah , so uh\nProbably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .\nYeah , maybe . Maybe .  Right , um where did you find this ?\nJust down here ? Yeah .\nOkay .  Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .\n'Kay . Um , can we just go over that again ?\nSure .\nUh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . Okay . So cost  like production cost is twelve fifty ,\nAll together .\nbut selling price is  is that wholesale or retail ? Like on the shelf .\nUm I dunno . I imagine  That's a good question .\nOur sale our sale anyway .\nI imagine it probably is our sale actually\nYeah , okay okay .\nbecause it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um .\nOkay . Mm-hmm .\nBut I  I don't know ,\nAlright .\nI mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?\nYes .\nThink it will ? Um .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nHmm .\nWell right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones .\nOh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah .\nUm f frequencies or something\nYeah . Okay .\num as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols .\nHmm .\nYeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be\nUm .\nI suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .\nI don't know . Yeah .\nIt does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nSo , possibly .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nAnd then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so\nWhat , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?\nJust a chara just a characteristic of the\nLike how much money people have to spend on things like ?\nJust  Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows ,\nAye , I see what you mean , yeah .\nsomething like that , yeah .\nMarketing . Good marketing thoughts .\nYep .\nOh gosh , I should be writing all this down . Um .\nRight away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here ,\nMm .\nthinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic ,\nYeah .\nsomething other than just standard . Um so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the  thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or\nYeah , yeah . Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .\nUh-huh .\nWell twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? Or no , is it as much as that ?\nMm-hmm .\nSixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .\nYep . Yeah , I'd say so , yeah .\nUm , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .\nNo . Yeah , yeah .\nBut yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .\nMm-hmm .\nUm right , okay . Let me just scoot on ahead here . Okay . Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? Thin\nDo we have any other background information on like how that compares to other\nNo , actually . That would be useful , though ,\nother\nwouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm . Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .\nYeah , yeah .\nIt's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something .\nOh . Five minutes to end of meeting .\nIt just comes along .\nOh , okay . We're a bit behind .\nDo you know what I mean ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nLike so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .\nI know um  My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .\nBut  Right . Right .\nSo um for them it was just how many devices control .\nOkay so  Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses\nYeah . Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know ,\nI think so .\ndo your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?\nYeah , yeah . Yeah . Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones ,\nMm-hmm .\neverything , agenda . So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market ,\nYeah .\nsuch as the lighting in your house , or um\nOr even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a\nYeah , yeah .\nOh that's a good idea . So extra functionalities .\nAn Yeah . Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them .\nMm-hmm .\nSo it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know , the sound and everything it's just one system .\nHmm .\nBut each one's got its own little part .\nUm okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . Um I'll just check we've nothing else . Okay . Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ?\nAnd you keep losing them .\nYou keep losing them .\nMm .\nOkay .\nFinding them is really a pain , you know .\nMm . Mm .\nI mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nor it's kicked under the table .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nW You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep .\nYeah .\nYou know .\nThat's just really good id Yep .\nThere  I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ?\nUh ,\nDunno .\nsure .\nOkay maybe .\nI remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_\nand big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something .\nMy goodness .\nAnd um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table .\nStill feels quite primitive .\nMaybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S\nMaybe like a touch screen or something ?\nSomething like that , yeah .\nOkay .\nOr whatever would be technologically reasonable .\nUh-huh , okay . Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer .\n'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having\nIt looks better .\nYou know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know .\nYeah .\nUm , nicer materials\nOkay .\nand might be\nOkay .\nbe worth exploring anyway .\nUh .\nRight , well um so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it\nYep .\nso y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually  what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess .\nOkay .\nUm .\nYeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess .  And uh and that's the end of the meeting . So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so\nUm .   Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here ,\nMm-hmm .\num , do we  We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something ,\nUh-huh , yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nright ? Well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ?\nTh Okay , well just very quickly\nI I don't know .\n'cause this  we're supposed to finish now . Um I guess that's up to us ,\nYep . Yeah , sure .\nI mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so um , you know\nOkay .\nI think one factor would be production cost .\nOkay , yeah .\nBecause there's a cap there ,\nYeah .\nso um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nI think that that's the main factor .\nYeah . Okay .\nOkay .\nRight , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . Um\nAlright .\nSo , uh\nthank you all for coming .\nCool .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "beagle, animals, animal, apes, beagles", "dialogue_id": 45}, {"text": "Yep . Soon as I get this . Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation .  Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that .  Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over .\nThe prototype discussion .\nThe prototype yeah . Do you need a  this ?\nNo .\nOkay .\nCan try to plug that in there\nThere is our remo  the banana .\nbut\nUm  yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana .\nUm but it would be held in such a fashion ,\nwhere it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .\nVery nice .\nAnd the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam . That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um  that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really .\nRight .\nIs there anything you want to add ?\nThat's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere ,\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nso  yeah ,\nDoesn't make much make much difference .\nyou have some rub yeah .\nYou could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose .\nExactly ,  use both . Might as well think about\nT the actual thing might be smaller .\nTh think about the button as well . Like either put either one  one on either side or\nYeah .\nWhat but what's that button ?\nnot do it at all . It's a quick on-off button .\nJust the on and off .\nUh , 'kay .\nThat's um\nyeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that .\n'Kay .\nRight ? Um that's not um\nI'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there .\nYeah .\nThere you go .\nIt's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh ,\nWould you like to uh\nRight .\nbut\nPretty impressive .\nWell done .\nKind of a banana .\nAnd whether or not it would fall into the cost  everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ .\nWell luckily we are going to find out . Or not luckily . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "prototype, presentation, evaluation, devices, ipod", "dialogue_id": 46}, {"text": "I do . Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Okay . So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that .  . Okay . So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ?\n.\nI think it's definitely different than anything else out there .\nMm .\nYeah .\nSo if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely .\nI would  .\nIt's bright .\nIt's bright . It's\nIt still has your traditional black .\nIt's curved . It's not  there's no sharp\nangles to it .\nYep , not angular .\nMm .\nI'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average .\nHowever the colour , we don't have a say in that .\nYeah I think the colours detract a little bit .\nSome people might say it . Yeah .\nThat has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company .\nMm .\nSo uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .\nYep .\nThat's true . Yeah .\nYeah .\n'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .\nYeah .\nBut\nYeah something more modern to go  a a modern colour to go with the modern form .\nRight . Right . It's different . You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .\nUm okay so , do you think , since we  This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ?\nYeah .\nDoes that sound good ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWhat do you think ? Three ? Four ?\nI would say\nFive ?\nfour .\nYeah .\nFour is fair . Okay .\nVery non-committal , four .\nOkay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ?\nIt's very intuitive , I think yeah .\nYeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .\nS give it a one .\nOne ,\nYeah .\n'kay . Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?\nUh yeah . 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls  most common , which are channel and volume .\nI'd say that\nMm-hmm .\nRight .\nAnd then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further .\nS scrolling through and selecting a few .\nRight . So that's a one .\nSo one ?\nI think that's a one .\nYeah ?  Okay . Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints .\nSomething that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .\nYeah .\nWhether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it .\nIt's bright yellow .\nBright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned .\nSo if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could\nJust just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily .\nOops . Hmm .\nAnd it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . That's gonna be a difficult shape to\nWell what\nAnd it is quite bright and\nYeah .\nMaybe in the middle again , three or four or something ?\nUh\nS\nOkay .\nI mean you know  loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways .\nYeah .\nYou can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it .\nMm .\nThat's true .\nBut if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think .\nMm .\nOh yeah . You probably\nYeah .\nProbably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then\nYeah .\nMm .\nI'd say two .\nWith the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget .\nYeah .\nY you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .\nYeah .\nWe could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .\nWhich , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a\nYes .\nYeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap .\nAnnoying alarm or something ?\nIt's it's\nYeah .\nSo it can't be that\nUm the  it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff ,\nexpensive .\nSome sort of proximity\nYeah .\nwhere you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much .\nYeah .\nSo that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your  stick it behind your T_V_ and the other\nstick it on the T_V_  .\nPray that you don't accidentally lose that piece .\nRight .\nThat'd be tough then .  Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .\nYeah .\nSo . Are we adding one of these two features ?\nLet's add one of those features and say yes .\ngonna say  okay .\nOkay .\nSo we're  back to a one ?\nTwo .\nOr a two ?\nTwo .\nTwo .\nTwo , 'kay . Okay . Are we technologically innovative ?\nUh\nI'd say so .\nUh don't get many mo remote controls with\nIt's all just\nscreens on .\nIt's all just stolen technology when it comes down to\nYeah it's stolen technology .\nFrom iPod yeah .\nIt's\nBut we have  .\nBut there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow .\nright\nBut for remotes  yeah .\nCourse that wasn't really\nright\nFa\nright right .\nwe were kinda forced to take that colour .\nTwo ? Three ?\n'cause it's stolen .\nI don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth .\nNo maybe not .\nYeah not really .\nBut how many remotes do you see like this ?\nIf we added the screaming factor  then we go up .\nNot so many .\nUm I would say we're probably at four .\nRight .\nReally ? Okay .  That's gonna hurt us .\nOkay . Um spongy material ?\nYeah well you have that , kind of , sort of .\nWe have some spongy , yeah .\nYeah as much as as needed , I think .\n'Kay .\nIt's not a one though .\nNo .\nOne would be the whole thing\nYeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side  the bottom  the underneath on the back .\nto fold and stuff . Yeah .\nYeah .\nSo that's a four at most .\nProbably a four at most . Possibly even a five .\nAnd lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ?\nY yes .\nYeah .\nI'd say we did .\nIf your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha .\nMore\nYeah .\nWell the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour ,\nOn the\nIt's true .\nYeah .\nbut it definitely is\nBe what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely .\n.\n'Kay . Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen . Seventeen divided by s\n.\nSeven is\nEight .\nTwo point\ntwo point four ?\nIs that some long division ? No .\nSomething .\nWell I haven't done math in years .\nWhat two\nI dunno .\nJust , I'm sure there's a  .\nOkay we'll say two point four two . Right ? How does that look ?\nI'm impressed . I can't do that without a calculator .\nNo I can't do long\nIt's been a while .\nvery impressive .\nAnd what what is the acceptable criteria ? Is there like a scale that we have to hit ?\nOh no . They just told me to\npick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it  basically .\nAlright then .\nSo that's that .\nOkay .

Yeah we'll go with that .\nSo I have here an\nFifty percent , you're kidding .\nNot too shabby .\nYeah .\nP\nWe want a fifty percent profit on this .

Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on ,\nbut so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories .\nBattery .\nWe have energy source , electronics , case . Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . Okay so  Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ?\nProbably some e either two or four .\nTwo .\nTwo ?  Like it .\nAt four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . People can change it every month .\nExcellent .\nThey won't know until after they bought it .\nThis is consumerism .\nAlright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker .\n.\nWe're advanced chip are we ?\nThat's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah .\n'Kay ,  we have one of those . 'Kay then the case is a  Probably it's double curved .\nDouble curved , yes .\nCase materials are\nPlastic .\nplastic . Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom .\nN no .\nIs that right or is it just one ?\nNo that's just one .\nMaybe it's one because of the\nIt's just one mo single mould , we can do that .\n'Kay .\nYeah  yeah .\nRight .\nI guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice .\nExactly , right .\nOh .\nSpecial colour ?\nThat's not a special colour . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special .\nBright yellow .\nInterface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display .\nS\nS\nThat's  Yeah .\nSo we actually have the L_C_D_ display\nAnd then\nand then is it the integrated or is it\nI'd say the integrated .\nYeah .\nYes unfortunately .\n'Kay . Button supplement ? Special colour ?\nMm .\nUm special form ? Special material .\nWe could of course make the buttons wood .\nSay mahogany or so\nIt'd look really lovely .\nOr titanium .\nMm-hmm or titanium .\nThey cost us all the same .\nYeah .\nremote control  .\nWell we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged ,\nUh just\nwe shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements .\nNo that's getting a bit tiny .\nUm\nYeah .\nI'd ignore that .\nLeave it blank .\nOkay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five . Which I believe is\nYeah that's too much .\nby three Euros over .\nIt's hard to believe . So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ?\nSo the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake .\nIf it w What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on .\nAnd just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though .\nYeah 'cause the\nWell 'cause we have to have both right ?\nYeah .\nI mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television .\nYeah .\nYou can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen .\nMm-hmm .\nSo s yeah let's take away the\nYeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nif it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself .\nRight .\nSo we may not need the L_C_D_ display ?\nUh that is possible yeah .\nRight . We may not need it . There you go .\nWell there we go .\nPerfect .\nTwelve point five .\nThere we go .\nPerfect .\nOkay . So we just remove our\nScreen .\nscreen here .\nMake it a bigger dial .\nEasier to use .

Right from the start of the day .\nYeah I think\nWe sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought .\nwe st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning .\nUm  um\nBut as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ? Which was the whiteboard and the pens .\nYeah . We've used the whiteboard .\nSuper super .\nI had some problem with the pen I think , but  minus your p\nMinus your PowerPoint fiasco .\nWell that's not my fault . That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me ,\nNo I know . I'm\nWell\nyeah .

Yeah ?\nYep .\nI guess so . So  Let's see . First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh  if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart ,\nMy name's Frank .\nhello . Hello .\nI'm  .\nBart . Hello . Hello . Bart .\nWelcome .\nThank you .\nUh let's see . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation . Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . You can see there are a few cameras here . They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off . Is being modified by the administrator . Uh okay  .\nHmm , that's interesting .\nLet's do it read only . Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . Uh it's a company in uh electronics . We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . I'm Bart  the project manager so I'll direct you through the project . This is our agenda .  Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .\nUh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or  Let's see . Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while .\nSure .\nI dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? Yeah .\nYep .\nYep . Visit it .\nHave you seen any flaws in it ? I think I found one .  No ?\nHmm ?\nCan't say I paid much attention to it ,\nI can see if it works this way . No , it doesn't work here .\nOkay no problem . But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh  there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction .\nOh yeah .\nReal Remote is not really the company we're  we are , but it's just a little  fault .\nOkay . Yeah .\nUm okay , what are we going to do ?  Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you .  We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look .\nOkay .\nAnd Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original .  And we've got our User Interface Designer .\nYep .\nHe's also uh  That's about the new remote control . Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design .  I had some role indications on here . But I think you know it already by yourself . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design .  And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project  uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings .\nThen we've got our first tool training .  We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the  think it is form of .\n'Kay .\nYou can also select the current colour and the line width . But then first you have to select the pen function .\nHmm .\nBut we're going to work with it in a minute . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there .  Uh then a short thing about documents . We've got our shared folder , project  project  what was it ? Project documents  I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder .\nOkay . Yeah .\nHere is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings . And then we're going to try out the white board .\nSo as you can see we g all  going to draw a animal .  Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it .\nMouse wasn't running away .\nThat was interesting .\nIs everybody  is anybody playing with the mouse ? No .\nInnocent .\nOkay .\nWe're going to uh draw animal .  And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics .\nUm the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width .\nUh there's  I can start from now . I will . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good .\nOkay .\n'Kay .\nAnother thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate . Then the line width . I think seven will be nice . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities .\nThese are not very much , but uh  Uh , see you have to do it real slow .  Oh\nSure .\nAh I was trying to draw a dolphin ,\nbut I think his nose has to be a little bit\nBut it's close .\nI'm thinking about a swordfish .\nSo what  yeah it's  this is bit of the swordfish .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah , he hasn't got an eye .\nMm-hmm .\nWoah .  Now we've got another function . We've got the eraser .\n.\nAnd then you can undo this easily .\nMeat .\nAh it's okay .\nAnd I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . Uh is  They've got no text tool , no . Uh .  Okay .\nThis is typically a undo action , I think .\nYeah .\nPen . Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . But I don't know , I'm just trying .   This is not my work ,\nokay .\nHmm .\nMaybe you have to use  Oh .\nUh . I think it's a  it wants to draw a  another animal ? I don't know . It lives for the fun . So  It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nGo ahead .\nThank you . Okay . Gonna use a different line width . And I'm gonna draw in black . There . 'Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go .\nMaybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . Because this is going a lot better than uh I did .\nHmm .\nA sheep .\nMm .\nOkay .\nThis is my um  Hmm . Sheep .\nIt's nice .\nWith of course\nUh .\nlittle blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .\nIt's a real dead sheep ,\nThere .\nyeah .  For recognition ,\nYeah .\nyeah , I see .  Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere .\n'Kay .\nOn just a\nThey are\nCome on . You have to go really slow when you're writing .\nYeah .\nThey're brilliant animal animals .\nAnd that's just a little me thingy . So . Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer .\nNice .\nOkay . Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head , but mm  Let's see . Mm . Uh .  Okay .\nSweet .\nYeah .\nInteresting .\nYou know what that is ? Or who ?\nGarfield .\nA rabbit ?\nAh okay , yeah .\nGarfield . Yeah .\nJust a  Mm . Guess . So uh   Yeah . That's enough .  Um , you say a blank ,\nYeah , just a blank sheet .\nor  Okay .\nWell I was gonna draw a cat too , so .\nI'll just try something else .\nNo .\nSomething different than Garfield .\nMine is a bit more skinny .\nYeah , it's pretty skinny cat .\nYeah .\nBut uh\nAnd the most interesting tail .\nIs your cat , or did you find him on the street ?\nWell , it's supposed to be a cat . I like cats because uh they are uh independent .\nAh .\nThe pen . So .\nOkay . That's pretty clear . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask\nYeah .\nThe pen .\nand go ahead . It's pretty uh easy .\n'Kay .\nS\nWe're being haunted .\nhaunted white board .

Oh really ?\nNo ?\nHuh .\nYou ?\nIt's a\nNo , me neither .\nWell , we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player .\nAh yeah .\nAnd I think it's  it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .\nYep . Yeah\nSure . Yeah .\nI've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .\nOkay , yeah . Yeah .\nAnd it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor .\nOkay , yeah .\nOh\nSo that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um\nreally .\nHmm . Oh . Mm-hmm .\nYeah .\nthing .

So , um\nplugged in .\nF_ eight , w . Function F_ eight .\nF_ okay . Function F_ eight . Sorry about this guys .\nNo problem .\n'Kay .  is on . Right .  Okay . I will take this time just to apologise .\nI , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing ,\nwhich is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing .\nBut there we go .\nI'm sure it's fine .\nUm , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . Um , from  Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere .\nUm , so that would work . Um , oop . Go back there . Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory .\nSo they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .\nRight , um , one question . This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ?\nYeah .\nSo that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?\nUm  And then  Yeah . Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components ,\nYeah .\nand then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .\nMm-hmm . Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ?\nYou could  we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . For a certain percentage at least .\nAlright .\nNot every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce ,\nOkay . This sounds like a really great idea .\nbut\nOne thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .\nYeah . Yeah .\nUm , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company ,\nYeah .\num 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .\nWell I  the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . Because of this , their properties are smart material .\nMm-hmm .\nAll you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves .\nAlright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications .\nSo I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but\nAlright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .\nYeah . Okay . Um also there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet .\nI'm sorry , could you\nThere we go\nThose were um\n. Sorry , should I go back . This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet .\nOkay .\nSo I just  put all those components in .\nSo those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . Those are all the\nYeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself .\nAlright . Great .\nOkay ?

Okay .\nThat looks right .\nYeah .\nOkay . I'm the User  um User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television .\nI'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and\nSorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself .\nCh Oh , I see .\nYeah . Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .\n'Kay .\nUm , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included . So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Does anyone have any questions ?\nSo as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?\nWell , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices .\nRight .\nAnd it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent ,\nD_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ?\nyeah ,\nRight .\nOkay .\nother entertainment devices .\nDoes everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?\nUm ,  I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more .\nYeah . Yeah .\nAnd limit the design  . Do you think ?\nYeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing .\nYeah . Yeah . That's true . Yeah .\nYeah .\nSo\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWe'll have more money to go into the design side of it .\nYeah .\nOkay . Yeah .\nAlright . Sounds great .\nMm , 'kay .\nAlright , well , um ,", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remote, television, presenter, controls, buttons", "dialogue_id": 48}, {"text": "are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ?\nYes I am .\nFabulous . Except you're not hooked up to the\nOh ,\nI'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready .\nGreat .\nOkay . Okay . Oh . I just lost my microphone .\nNo problem ,\nJust a moment .\nwe can\nOkay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings . Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household .\nI'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ?\nUm , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design .\nMm-hmm .\nAny trends that are going on in , in the public , even media ,\nMm .\nyou know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched ,\nYeah .\num , to influence our remote control . Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number .\nUm , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .\nI'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ?\nYeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality .\nOkay .\nAs opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control .\nMm . Yeah .\nUm , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot .\nMm-hmm .\nThey're you know thumb-masters . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . Thought that was interesting .\nAlright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons .\nMm .  the single function .\nAnd another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable ,\nYeah .\nbecause I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button .\nYes .\nYeah that's a good point .\nYeah . Yeah .\nAnd actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour .\nThat's a huge amount . This is the most important button . Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . And it's used on average four times an hour . Not as much as channel selection , but still significant . Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . Relevance is two . Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . Flipping pages .\nIt's um\nIs that\nIt's like the news . Or like information .\nIt has  T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment .\nYeah .\nThe\nIt's um\nand what's on .\nSo like a running banner , underneath\nNo it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up .\nNo , li Yeah .\nI haven't used it before\nYeah .\nbut\nOh .\nIt's like\nAnd you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up .\nIt's like very basic internet . Sort of ,\nOkay .\nVery basic internet , yeah .\num\nBut you have\nOkay . Like tells you the weather , and\nYeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know .\nOkay .\nLike the internet you can send emails and  You've no interaction .\nYeah , it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and\nRight .\nYeah .\nAlright . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't  But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . Channel settings .\nUh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ?\nP Sorry . Changing the channels ?\nTuning them in at the very start . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels ,\nTo get the right reception and picture , I suppose .\ndo you th do you think ?\nOh , okay .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah . Okay .\nMm .\nUm , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . Okay . Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .\nSo it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .\nRepetitive strain injury .\nRepeti Uh .\nAh .\nI think .\nIs that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ?\nThat's rather sad .\nUm , maybe our\nOh , I'm guessing that's what it is . I'm not\nYeah , yeah . I think it is .\ndesigners can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond .\nMm . Yeah .\nBut we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem .\nYeah . It is .\nOkay . Did you guys uh get that one down ?\nMm-hmm .\nYep .\nUm  okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here . Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .\nI agree with um  if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally .\nMm-hmm .\nUm , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that .\nMm .\nUm , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned .\nSo that , that's a whole other field of research . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and depending on how many members you have in households .\nYeah .\nSo it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway .\nYeah . And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself .\nRight .\nWonder if it would have\nYeah .\nAnd if there was conversation in the room at the same time ,\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nalthough in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television ,\nbut   could be very difficult to get the specific uh design .\nYeah . If we're looking for a simplistic design , if\nMm-hmm .\nWe need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design .\nYeah . Mm .\nUm , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated\nIt looks like\nYeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing ,\nMm-hmm .\nbecause if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure .\nIt'd be like the ultimate remote .  Um  okay . And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working .\nYeah .\nSo that you don't have so many buttons to deal with .\nUm , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is .\nOh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . S Or like um\nMobile phone .\nMm .\nYeah .\nYeah . Or  Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock .\nWhat , what would appear on the screen ?\nI have no idea still .  I'm sorry .\nOh just like an electronic screen . As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on\nOh , on the remote . Okay .\nYeah . Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen .\nYeah .\nUm , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting .\nYeah . Could it it  It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be\nLike linked in with the teletext ,\nYeah . That would be good , yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nor sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .\nYeah . Might be quite expensive to do that though .\nMm , Yeah . Could be .\nWell I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research .\nRight .\nMm-hmm .\nUm , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . Um , we want something that people want in their home . Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people .\nYeah .\nUm , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off .\nSo if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product\nMm .\nUm , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out\nMm-hmm .\nand , yeah .\nRight . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .\nEarly twenties , that's the kind of age group .\nYeah . And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control ,\nTwenties .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .\nYeah . Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm .\nYep .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAlright .\nOkay .\nOkay . That's it for the market research .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remote, presentation, coffee, electronic, interaction", "dialogue_id": 48}, {"text": "Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on  we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because  Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option .\nCan I just interrupt ?\nYep .\nWould you like to plug in your\nYeah . Maybe we can do the\nOkay , sure .\nHave you got a PowerPoint or not ?\nYeah I do . I'm looking at  looking at it right now .\nOkay . Thanks .\nThere you go .\nthank you .\nOh , come back screen .\nHmm .\nWere they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?\nUm , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nbut um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used .\nOkay . Yeah . Okay .\nAlright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um  We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way .\nRight . Yeah .\nSo , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good .\nYeah . Okay .\nUm , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company\nJust\nbut , another thing is that , um\nwe need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .\nOkay . Work on that .\nIt's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThe little R_ R_ yellow thing ? Okay .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nYeah , I think .\nReal Reaction ? Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television .\nOkay .\nIt'll  It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve .\nOkay , so I  Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ?\nYeah .\nIs that how most people feel about that ?\nYeah .\nYeah ?\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition .\nI think it would be annoying though if  I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if\nYeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous .\nYou'd  Yeah .\nYeah .\nSo is it just\nYeah .\nNever heard of it .\nOkay . Alright .\nYeah . I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ .\nRight .\nDo you know if anywhere else has it ?\nI don't know .\nI don't know .\nMore research required , I think .\nI don't know .\nAlright .\nBut if  Was it a management decision that we're having\nIt was a management decision ,\nOkay .\nso it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point .\nSo\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay then .\n'Kay . So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple .\nUm , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons .\n'Kay .\nUm .\nMinimal\nAnd the  What was the word they used ? F findability is important .\nYeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had .\nYeah okay .\nMm-hmm .\n'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared\nYeah .\nYeah . The same signalling .\nthe same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise .\nI mean\nIt's not that expensive to do .\nOr vibrate just the same as a mobile phone .

The button\nWell , if the button was actually on\nOh .\nYeah .\nOh , yeah .\nMinor detail there .\nC 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something .\nMaybe  Yeah , yeah .\nYeah , it would have t\nMaybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nObviously something small that's  Yeah , that's a good point .\nYeah .\nYeah .

Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nit doesn't\nI would go for\nIt could it could be a tactile thing as well . Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger .

Could be raised .\nBut then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .\nJust little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ?\nYeah\nYeah .\nHmm .\nI just thought that  it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThat's true .\nBut I mean\nAnd also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody .\nYeah .\nUm , so like big b um buttons ,  for people you are visually impaired . The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody .\nThat , I think that's good , yeah .\nYeah . Could we somehow  We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\n'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nNo , it's not these days .\nNo , I wouldn't say so .\nI mean , it's quite easily accessible .\nYeah .\nI guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nThat's good  Yeah that a good idea .\nso if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nAnd you don't want to turn on the lights ,  to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby .\nYeah .\nUm , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it .\nYeah .\nIt lights up for\nYeah .\nThat , yeah , that's a good idea .\nOn self timer .\nSo self-timed lighting .\nAlright we have five minutes left\nYeah .\nUm , I\num , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . Um , what was  I missed the last moment , reading that . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?\nOh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while .\nYeah . Yeah .\nUm , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .\nMm . So it could be any button that would be pressed .\nYeah .\nYeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow .\nSo , self-timed\nSo if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it .\nYeah .\nBecause usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds .\nYeah .\nOkay , so\nYeah .\nSo\nThat's probably feasible .\nYeah .\nSo , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this .\nI think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , okay .\nAnd I think that's un unique as well .\nYeah . For visually impaired , yeah .\nYeah .\nI mean , I haven't seen that . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , yeah . And it could  , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no\ndurable .\nwhat's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ?\nOh yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOh right , the\nYeah instead of like hard buttons .\nRepetitive strain injury .\nOkay . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ?\nMm-hmm .\nOr did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ?\nIf\nLike should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .\nI was gonna say ,\nYeah .\nExactly . It the  it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark .\nYeah .\nIt's kind of like Eighties neon-style .\nYeah , and we could\nUm , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable .\nYeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well ,\nSo\nwhich could like link in with the company colours . Like it could be blue or green or yellow ,\nRight .\nMm-hmm .\nor like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so\nRight . Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things .\nI was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .\nYeah . Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well .\nMm .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOr , or the , whate\nYeah .\nYeah .\nBut with the same thing , I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well .\nThat's true .\nYeah .\nYeah . Okay .\nIs  Are you okay with that ? Okay . Cool .\nYeah .\nUm  Alright . So I think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions .\nIs\nAnd now it's up to designing . And um making sure that this can be feasible . And do you have anything\nWhat um\nDo you have anything to say ?\nOh sorry . Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um\nOkay . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something .\nOh yeah . Interchangeable thing ?\nYeah ,\nLike an iPod or something ?\nThat would be good .\nYeah , or\nExactly , like an iPod .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nExactly .\nOkay .\nOr , or like mobile ph .\nLike a cellphone ? Yeah .\nAnd I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . Like a Bart Simpson faceplate .\nYeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well .\nBut\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nY Could buy extra\nMm-hmm .\nAccessories .\nExactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .\nPerson\nYeah .\nYeah . Well , that's great .\nThat's a good idea . Yeah .\nYeah . I think that we should incorporate that .\nInterchangeable .\n'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all .\nUm , als\nYou'd just get one mould ,\nNo .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nthrow some plastic in it , you know .\nInterchan And also possible  I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or\nYeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues .\nOh yeah .\nRight .\nSo , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out .\nYeah . But if we , there is\nIf w\nYeah . We could  Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .\nRight .\nRight .\nWe'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Um , does it need to be reached a de\nYeah .\nDo we need to reach a decision on that right now ?\nUm , I've\nBecause we need to investigate the financial implications .\nOkay .\nOkay . Is it\nLet's\nDoes it need to be uh decided on now ? Or should we\nI think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then .\nOkay . Good . Alright then .

Yes .\nSo w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other .\nSee what our roles are in this project . So , um  We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh  to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope  how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design .\nMm-hmm .\nTotal .\nUh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh  wh what uh what our new product should look lite  like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um  We  When you design a new product you of  uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh  we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that .\nSo , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um  You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a  a  a white-board .\nWhitebo\nMm-hmm .\nAnd um well it should work uh  I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so  Um\nUnder documents in the shared folder . Okay .\nYes . Do  Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh .\nYeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah .\nYes well we will then find out ho how it works .\nYes .\nUm . Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . So , we'll come to that later . So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . So , I would suggest uh\nEach of us is going .\nWell , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I   I'm not really sure how this works , but\nOkay , shall I start ?\nMm . Yeah .\nYes ,\nYeah ,\na good idea Mael .\nyou can start it you know .\nI think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down .\nSo , i\nNo they will record through that .

Maybe someo Maybe  maybe Anna , maybe you can start .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nThen he can maybe find out to get his cord right .\nI have to draw .\nSo um  L Why don't you draw uh  your favourite animal on on th on the white-board .\nM my  my favourite animal .  Sorry this is all tangled up here .\nOh , I see uh\nThat's better .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yes . Mm . So draw it . We will try to guess what it is .\nMm-hmm .  I'm a very bad drawer .\nWeird . Um . You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . I'm a bad drawer . Okay .\nMm .\nThey're ears , by the way .\n's a cat .\nNo . Um close though . Okay so  like a pet animal .\nOkay .\nLike a cat .\nYeah .\nIt's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat .\nNo , not a cat though .\nWhat is this now ?\nAh you forget about it .\nYou're on the knife .\nYeah , uh I think it's fine . I just don't want to carry it off . Man , this wires , eh ? We need a wireless microphone .\nYou know ? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that .\nOkay . So .\nSo ,\nIt's not a cat ,\nthat's the cat .\nit's a dog .\nOh .\nSo .\nMael .\nIt's a dog .\nYes .\nSo but that's also kind of cat ,\nOh\nisn't it ?\nthe dog doesn't have a tail ?\nIt's got a tail then .\nB bo both predators .\nYeah , sure , yeah .\nYeah yeah .\nI thought so . The dogs have a tail .\nSo do cats .\nSo , thank you . Uh d did you uh work out cord ?\nAnd you guessed cats without a tail .\nYeah .\nYeah , I think I will go without  without it ,\nOkay .\nOkay .\nright ?\nIt'll still not extend , right ? It's not up to that .\nOkay , there you go . So what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . A horse ?\nIt's a horse .\nThis is why you're the designer . And I'm marketing .\nYes . Yes , yes this is  Yes definitely a horse . Yes . Oh very good . So\nAh\nI suppose it\nAh I think you can put that .\nMm-hmm . That's it .  A blue and black zebra  .\nYes . Can  you can meet them in Africa , I think . Yes . Very good . So\nThe very rare blue zebras . Yes .\nI'll tell to get it off my\nMa Matthew ?\nUh ? Mm-hmm .\nSo\nYou got a lot of room here .\nMaybe\nYou can probably reach .\nOh y it's not for that .\nNo ?\nNo .\nI hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael .\nOkay . Yeah . So what should I draw ? Mm . He has already to do cat .\nI took a dog .\nUm . A mouse ?\nThis looks likes a cat who has been driven over .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nAnd we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ?\nMm-hmm .\nYes , the moustache .\nSo\nThat's  that's definitely a cat .\nMm-hmm .\nUh yeah . And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this .\nIt's quite , you know  relaxed situation .\nYeah .\nYes .\nMm-hmm .\nYes , okay .\nShe has the small legs .\nTh thank you , Matthew .\nYeah .  Thank you , Matthew .\nIt's a very big rat . Or a very small cat .\nPerfect .  Oh a rat , okay .\nYes , this is certain uh  some contribution to our project .\nMm 'kay .\nAnd you ,\nYour turn .\nSo . Let's see . Which animal has not been drawn yet . So you've all drawn land animals ,\nso why not draw an animal from the water .\nA bird . Okay , in the water .\nAh I don't know what that is . It's a bit\nMm .\nMm .\nIt's a bit hard to guess .\nYeah .\nSo\nPut it colours . Maybe it would help us .\nYeah .\nYes .\nThe cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ?\nWith different pen widths .\nMm-hmm.$\nSo\nOh , it's a shark now .\nAh it's a shark , yeah .\nOh , yes , why not ?\nGood idea .\nAh it's a baby shark , it looks to me ,\nMm .\nyou know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ?\nOh .\nNow it's a swordfish .\nWhy not . A swordfish .\nYou have some in  in Australia , right ?\nSwordfish .\nYeah .\nUm , maybe .\nI dunno .\nI've never seen one , no .\nOh well . Yeah .\nI hope it still works . So\nPerfect . So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually  But uh\nYou should go for the next one it seems to me .\nW Well , this uh this tool seemed to work .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , exactly , yeah .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "mic, microphone, clip, presentation, recording", "dialogue_id": 49}, {"text": "Let's continue to uh  to the real stuff .\nWow .\nUm our project uh finance uh thing .

Per project .\nYes . Okay . Um\nmore interesting for our company  of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh  um things . Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America ,\nAh yeah , the sale man , four million .\nmaybe some uh Asian countries . Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .\nSo it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics .\nYes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ?\nThey have to sell at least four million to make a profit\nOf course .\nMm .\nYou all have to be paid .\nMm .\nExcuse me ?\nAh we have to make  we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit .

The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up .\nMm , well uh I I think  Uh w y you two should  should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality .\nActually , yeah\nLet's  Let's take\nw  Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements .\nMm .

That was  generally   how helpful that was .\nUm , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're  Right , um  So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what  where you've come from our last time .

Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .\nAnd why not wood ?\nAnd ,\nAnd why not wood ?\nhmm ?  Uh , well we can use wood .  I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design .\n'S good .\nUm , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material\nHmm .\nYeah .\nwhich is quite shocking .\nHa . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the  is the current trend\nand and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion .\nMm .\nThe fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to  I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables ,\nbut that's just a personal opinion .\nI think\nI think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room .\nUh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?\nUm , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find  come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter .\nMm-hmm .\nThank you for your attention .\nSo .\nI think it's the next  it's the blue one , yeah .\nOh , uh , there we go .  Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh .\nI actually wasn't aware of the  new trends in electronics\nand and uh\nNeither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um  fabrics .\nYeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "custom, designing, design, remote, buttons", "dialogue_id": 50}, {"text": "So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh  Okay , alright anyway . Um  here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying  we're gonna try to talk about , um  what kind of uh  how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .\nAnd , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system .  Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of  I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?\nOh we s hadn't discussed it last time .\n'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this  it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um  the wheel\nYou need a screen for it ?\nyou  it seems like you would need a screen .\nYou need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So\nBut like if you think about it  yeah but if  so is it just  okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?\nWe're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ ,\nAre we\nthat was one of th I I was\nYeah .\nOkay .\nsorry ,\nI I meant to update you on that . Um .\nAlright . Okay .\nBut the screen can come up on the telly , the  she said .\nOkay . Okay .\nYeah .\nThat correct ?\nSo anyway if  well we just  we need to  Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen  I think  I was thinking  okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna  I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a  right .\nGraphical interface ?\nYeah like you're g\nUh on the  you can have it on the telly though .\nYeah .\nyeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can  okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .\nYeah .\nSo that    people seems to be  well\nYou've  Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to\nYou know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um  I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because  So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if  or or  then again if you just  I guess  I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on .\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nYou can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or\nYeah , yeah .\nBut but imagine someone with s\nMy flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .\nI oh yeah ?\nBut i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to\n'Cause you'll have to like\nYeah .\nThey have to r wheel really fast .\nbut you can quickly s you can\nYeah .\nBut I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels ,\nYeah .\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nat least on theirs .\nYeah if you do , it w so it would have to be  you  I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um  So you're either  you're  you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different\nYeah .\nuh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like  from five to six you could tap or someth\nRight .\nAnd then there's also the concern about you know um  how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um  you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that ,\nYeah I mean with that many options , you'd   uh  I'd think that the screen would be better ,\nlike\nbecause you could have that menu option , sort of\nI would think so too , like  So I mean  and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because\nYeah .\nbut then again it would  it does make kind of  if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of\nYeah .\nIt's more expensive according to the design people .\nm yeah .\nUh .\nYeah , that's the only thing though .\nYou have to get a  an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .\nYeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um\nMm .\nYou can get to  you know , you can  Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can  it brings up like the menu on the T_V_\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nand you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the\nYeah .\nSo the T_V_ is the screen , that  yeah\nyeah , yeah .\nSo it would have all these different options of changing\nYeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .\nto\nLook it even has settings .\nOkay .\nHmm ?\nOn the\nYeah .\nyou can just take theirs and just\nYeah , well we don't want the screen I guess ,\nYeah .\nbut um  'cause that just  it does seem like , it  that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but  I dunno , and then  so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .\nSo", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "ipod, interface, screen, touch, remote", "dialogue_id": 50}, {"text": "Um , right .

So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean\nYeah . Yeah definitely .\nokay .\nLike , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing .\nYeah .\nI mean it it needs to be easy to\nYeah but should be comfortable .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nsomehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your\nYeah .\nI mean how do how do  I'm not really  Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it .

Yeah .\nSo we just used the top part .\nMm yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , so  but I mean I think it could be pretty small .\nUh .\nLike , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can\nWhat if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ?

I mean I've never bought a remote .\nI'm not sure .\nIt sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television ,\nWell they usually are .\nwhich is a little\nWell\nMy  I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know .\nNo .\nHuh .\nBut um\nI guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ .\nSo , um  but I mean it's  I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .\nYeah , it  most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .\nYeah . Yeah . Well so  So , do we need  I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about  But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . Okay .\nThat's what it does anyway .\nBut also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you  like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand ,\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nyou don't know they mean , yeah , it's like\nand I never get it .\nyeah .\nYeah .\nNever ever .\nSo , but\nSo\noh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ?\nWell on the telly .\nOr on the T_V_ too .\nOn the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea\nbecause you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those  like okay now I hit this  you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .\nMm . And it is technologically innovative in a way ,\nMm .\nso that fits with the\nYeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are  really hot right now , so\nB Yeah .\nDid you did you get that pc picture on  did they provide you with that picture on the web ?\nUm , yeah , by web research , yeah , so\nThat's quite interesting . What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ?\nOh god .\nOh , I was gonna say .\nOh .\nYou said uh people want spongy .\nUm , one of your\nYeah .\nYeah .\none of the material options is a sort of rubber that's  in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy .\nOh , okay , that would be cool .\nAh .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm .\nJust nice feel , but I hate spongy .\nYeah .\nYeah , c that's e that would be kind of  oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing .\nYeah . I mean definitely the area round it .\nBut what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda\nso you're like\nYeah I think it could work .\nYeah .\nOr what if we integrated the  the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables\nwe somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like\nDon't think I'd want it to feel like a banana .\na vegetable .\nWell it could be like mobiles that just  you just put a cover .\nAn orange .\nYeah .\nIf it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana ,\nwhich frankly I'm not particularly fond of ,\num you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYou know you had  there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .\nYou could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or\nYeah .\nAnd it could  the colour can fit your sitting room ,\nso if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have  well I don't know . Um .\nYeah .\nSo what if  what\nSo I think\nthis is\nyeah , colours .\nI'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there .\nIs that kind of\nYeah .\nI  'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours .\nYeah .\nUm\nUnfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables .\nI do I dunno . Um\nI mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just  the feedback we've just got about the\nMaybe a ball .\nA ball ?\nKnow , a squashy ball .\nA relaxing squashy ball .   That you can p\nThat's in the shape of a fruit , like a\nwell I  see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit\nYeah .\nand I'm thinking how do you change the hard  would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a\nThis is just  Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy .\nOh , okay , yeah . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for\nThat  see I was thinking this s\nWhich is cheaper .\nsorry\nWell I don't know if it's cheaper actually .\nI was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing .\nOh . Mm .\nYeah .\nAnd like this  you could have like you could have like cherries and  things around there .\nOh I like that shape .\nYeah .\nUm but\nI was thinking sort of a single ball shape .\nI was thinking if it was like this\nYeah  .\nSo you're holding a squishy ball\n'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy\nand then it has a  Mm-hmm .\nIt's like it has to be s\nIt's almost like your thumb is farther up ,\nyeah  .\nso if if you could squish it lower then\nYeah I guess so .\nYeah .\nYeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either  like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .\nYeah , I know what you meant , yeah .\nWhat if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can  so so maybe one you know  you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing\nand you could get  you could have your choice , you know ?\nWell just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover .\nBut  well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that ,\nYeah , yeah .\nMm .\nand for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is ,\nYeah .\nOkay .\nand\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nNo .\nOh .\nUm . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater .\nYeah .\nHmm . Well that's not very neat , but\nUm .\nYeah . I mean I think uh  and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely  So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part .\nIf it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your  to the way you hold it .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah you could squish it .\nIf it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you  it it just moulds to your hand .\nYeah .\nYeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ?\nI guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .\nFruits and veg .\nWe we don't know .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd the rest is the company  the company colour's silver ?\nIt was , yeah , silver and yellow . It l it looks like   I don't\nWe could promote the banana one .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nLike  mm .\nI mean that's another question , where are we gonna  we we should have the logo somewhere on it .\nMm .\nMm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't\nYeah .\nI think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case .\nOh yeah .\nYeah , th and that would  that\nYeah .\nOkay .\nEspecially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits .\nBut uh it\nWell I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .\nYeah .\nNo but it does it automatically .\nDoes it automatically ?\nYeah .\nI don't know .\nI don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me .\nBut if someone\nOkay .\ncomponents concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark .\nThat was me .\nWas that you ?\nYes .\nOkay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And\nUh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo ,\nwhich is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .\nOh , a dynamo is  ah ,  it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .\nOh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself .\nSo I sort of picked battery .\nIt's quite sweet .\nWe could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .\nI think batteries sound good .\nIt  it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .\nWhat does everyone else think ?\nThe dynamo would be interesting  .\nNo . But dynamo  the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it  creates energy on its own .\nWhat about Kryptonite ?\nOh .\nWhich is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost .\nYeah .\nDon't know the cost .\nDidn't have enough data to actually\nDoes anyone have costs on the on the web ?\nAll it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost .\nOkay . Right .\nHmm .\nMm .\nMost of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .\nWhat does chip on print mean ?\nUm , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip ,\nUh-huh .\ncalculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap .\nOkay .\nBut it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .\nRight . So , chip on print is just  means like that they're mass-produced .\nYeah .\nOkay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about ,\nCase is what we were discussing yeah .\nyeah .

Right .\nIt  it'd probably have to be labelled mute .\nThey're thinking\nBut um , we didn't have anything small enough to write .\nUh-huh .\nFor the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons .\nOkay . Mm-hmm .\nYeah . Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them .\nUm , the important ones are the volume ones . So we made them a bit bigger . The mute could possibly be a bit smaller .\nMm-hmm .\nHum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there ,\nYeah .\nand the the channel is in blue .\nMm-hmm .\nR right . Um ,\nYeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus .\nall these things have cost implications . And so when I done my thing on cost  a  I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . So  However , I've now  .  But um ,  yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that ,\nI'll see if I can find them .\nand uh  as I suppose that  so whether  wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose .\nYeah , sis\nWell the colours wouldn't  like that's  they wouldn't be too important ,\nHave\nbut we didn't have any white Play-Doh .  So that's where the colour buttons came from .\nAn important consideration .\nRight , okay so um   And the second one underneath would be the idea for the\nYes , we'll have the slide-away .\nRight , okay . So we've got um detail design meeting .\nBottom .\nRight . So  So , we've got  prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , um and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting .\nMm-hmm .\nSo other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nBut other than that , we got the red apple . We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons ,\nYes , yes .\nand  the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance .  And the  and the cost implication .\nOkay .\nRight .\nThe only snag about this is that uh  the cost is probably kind of important . So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture .\nMm-hmm .\nUm , and whether it would uh\nSo if you had to do a presentation or  will you just work it on the prototype ?\nThis this is a\nUh , that's it .\nyes , this is our presentation of the prototype .\nThat's the pr\nRight , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost  aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half  uh twelve and a half Euros .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nSo , there's no redesign . So that should uh  Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh\nCould we get this on the board just so we can see  or do you mean do you have the figures there ?\nwe should  plug it in .\nRight .\nDo you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one .\nOkay .\n'Kay , Alice . So , sh\nWe could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .\nRight .  .\n'Kay this should be then .\nOkay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and\nMm-hmm .  Have a push button interface .\nOkay . W the button supplements .\nUm\nWell , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . But\nUm\nSo the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons\nWell do we'll do it on the prototype ,\nO\nso do two , see how much it is .\nWell , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . Everything else is gonna be a standard .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWe've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,\nAnd then we'd have\nso , I was   originally , I was thinking  rubber wasn't special ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut according to this , maybe it is .\nMm-hmm .\nSo  And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there .\nYeah . I think you just do one , don't you , for the\nW  I don't know  is  is  is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore  I mean , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore\nI think I think it's just it's just a one . Else\nWhereas it would be  the special colour would be for the  So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .\nI thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons  made in a different material , rather than per button .\nMm .\nI don't know though .\nI would    Every design change is uh   sound] I dunno ,\nHmm .\num   Okay , um , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd have one special colour and one special button form .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd when I plugged that in last time   remember it has to be under twelve and a half . As far as I know , that um  that took care of the uh of the various supplements .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd if  What happened ?\nYou've just gone off the window into another one . It's on the bottom row .\nMaybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box .\nYeah .\nNow , right .\nOkay , so , but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special  Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .\nYeah . Yeah .\nOkay .\nSo that's nine point one there so we've got some\nSo it  Well , is it s is  no , it's nine point seven I've got .\n'Kay .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nJust give us a bit of\nSo , that would  that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are   assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nAnd there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on  .\nS\nI  switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one .\nUh-huh .\nUm , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ?\nYeah .\nWe should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech\nYeah .\nWell , hold on . Um , if we Okay , that gives us twelve point seven\nSo uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition\nBut remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the\nwithout\nOh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and\nYeah , yeah .\nUm ,  . D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? You know how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,\nYeah , we have to have it\nOh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe .\nso you need both of them ?\nYeah .\nMaybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic . Um\nAnd go for battery instead .\nYeah .\nThat would give you one less .\nWe should  Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov\nBut you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .\nYeah , yeah . Well , since it's the  through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . Um , whether they would figure the  the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd then still have the batteries ,\nMm-hmm .\nor whatever they would prefer not uh  You know what I mean ? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nSo you gotta decide which of those is more important to them .\nBut which do you think  or which do we think is the more important of the options ? In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .\nI think the voice recognition .\nAt least . Remember that was a minimum requirement . The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it  originally , we're gonna make it a simple product .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "file, spreadsheet, documents, replace, button", "dialogue_id": 51}, {"text": "Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?\nMm-hmm . Makes sense .\nOkay\nOkay . Right um , I have a little thing . So , we've all got a note of  it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on .\n. Sorry , do you want that back up ?\nYeah , I just had a presentation to do .\nRight .\nBut I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .\nOkay , but remember the main  the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .\nMm-hmm . Mm .  Right okay um , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here .\nAnd so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess .  And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um  The  whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently ,\nOkay .\nso  I'll go over here .  Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one  So\nOkay , well we have a single curve , which was  maybe like the feel of the product's quite good .\nYeah .\nSo uh\nOkay .\nUm , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nUm ,  sorry that'd be considered fancy .\nYeah , I'd maybe give it a a two .\nOf  but I think  What  Is one false , or is t one true ?\nOne's true .\nI forgot . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal\nAnd a four is neutral .\nFour is neutral , okay . So\nSo maybe  maybe a two .\nYeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true .\nGo for one .  Yep .\nRight .\nBut it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can .\nOkay . Right .\nOkay .\nI gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . So , false is seven , true is one , and  So uh say about a two for fancy ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nyou think ?\nYeah , why not not ,\nOkay .\nm m maybe nearer three .\nOkay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um\nTwo three . Well , it's just that uh saying something   remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options .\nUh-huh . This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .\nYeah , so that  so sh should we go for a a two on that ?\nOkay .\n'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?\nUm ,  deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .\nD yeah . Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is ,\nUm\nwe've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we .\nBut not the kinetic .\nBut not the kinetic .\nLike the power .\nNo . 'Cause you can't afford that  w we took that out too .\nNo , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both .\nAlright , so\nDidn't you ? Or\nSo it doesn't  It's pretty  The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the\nNo may is  maybe about neutral\nMaybe a three .\nplus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got\nOkay . Yeah .\nWell , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .\nI would give it more than a four .\nThe problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .\nRight .\nAnd one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic .\nOkay .\nSo , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then  because that\n'Kay .\nRight , okay .\nthe other functions we've got in are are more at the   The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors  speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nAnd and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker ,\nUm\nand then you're looking to uh take out uh point two ,\nS I'm just gonna check my email .\nwhich would be  come from the button supplements category .\nI'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product .\nHow much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .\nUm , interface type um ,\nAnd then it stand the test of time better .\nwell plastic rather than rubber .\nOkay . But I\nThat that that would make the significant difference . You could either  you could have it  If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get  you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd that would enable you to to do it .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nSo it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYe\n, I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or .\nWell , okay , but\nWell , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it .\nIt's rubber as it is , yes .\nSo , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the um the speech\nWe got  we've we've got thirteen point seven\nYeah .\nand we've got it in at the moment and if  and basically , we're going to reduce down from that .\nYeah .\nBut the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and\nMm-hmm . I would've said about a two as well .\nDo you reckon a two ?\nYeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two .\nOkay . Two .\nOh .\nAnd the next one is  I'll have to get it back up now .\nThe next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time .\nYeah . Yeah ,\nOkay .\nI would say so as well .\nUm , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some .\nUm\n.\nYeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess .\nIt does , yeah .\nUm\nYep .\nSay about a three maybe ?\nI don't know .\nYeah , m um\nMaybe two ?\nYeah , it was just doing it quite well .\nYep .\nUm , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's um\nYeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable .\nIt's a two .\nThe product is a recognisable real  r uh  reaction product ?\nYeah , this is\nUh  the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons ,\nThis\nand it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .\nYeah , that's a bit rough at the minute .\nYeah .  So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that .\nOh .\nOkay .\nSo  sort of  Is it sort of a recognisable product .\nDoes it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft .\nS\nUh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine .\nWhat do y\nAlso it's kind of  spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than  kinda sleek and new age .\nYeah .\nUm , it depends which way you look at it .\nUh-huh .\nOkay . So we're going for a two ,\nSo\nMaybe a kind of three ? Uh d\nthree ?\nYeah , two or three .\nTwo or three ?\nWell , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper .\nSure .\nBut um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable .\nYeah .\nAnd it does have attributes that other products do . Two ? Aye . Go for it .\nRight , okay .\nTwo or three .\nTwo .\nHow\nRight , come on . That's that decided .\nTwo . Okay .\nRight . So\nRight .\nSo we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then\nYeah .\nWhat does  what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate  or anything ?\nYeah we s yeah , I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be  I'm just gonna do this in my head .\nAbout a two .\nTwo .\nOne point eight isn't it or something .  I think , anyway . So yeah , pretty close to a two .\nYeah , so it's\nSo  So it's  I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it .\nYep .\nBut we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad .\nTwo b two b two  , yeah .\nSo should we get  So are  definite  Was it  thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if  has .\nYes .\nOkay , so we need to\nYeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "prototype, voice, evaluation, speaker, speech", "dialogue_id": 51}, {"text": "Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .\nDo you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances\nOkay , well I put it back on .\nSo I guess this  Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?\nI'm not sure .\nwe'll probably have to re-rate it .\nYes , I would've thought so .\nYeah , yeah we'll make the adjustments\nYeah .\nand then see how are rates are going .\nOkay , so what was it , control uh F_ eight , wasn't it ?\nAh it's on .\nit's come on already .\nOh . Oh . How kind .\nRight , okay . So , you can see there that the  If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item .\nOh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points ,\nThat's right .\nwhich gets us um  In  right within the budget range .\nWhich gets you\nMm .\nYes .\nYeah , I think that'd be fine . Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .\nSo that's eleven point seven ,\nYeah .\nand then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements .\nAlright .\nDifferent different colours , yeah . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case .\nPossibly , yeah . Um\nYeah .\nOkay , so\nAnd that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the  maybe kind of\nSo we're going for plastic , yes ?\nLose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but\nYep .\nOh yeah , and that would now be\nAnd then\nYeah , that's that's within the budget . Um  Do we actually have  Do we just have one special  uh  special forms down here ?\nWell , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . You got special colour .\nUm\nWell originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .\nAnd we we've we've got  we've got enough for another\nYeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons .\nwe've got nought point eight left ,\nYeah .\nso we've got enough for another\nWell , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special\nYeah , um\nSo so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .\nBut the  but  but but the\nThe other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .\nI think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because  the volume buttons are different ,\nYeah .\nI guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour .\nAlright . So , special colour , you want three in there .\nYeah , which I think we should  Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price .\nOkay .\nWell I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe .\nThat makes sense .\nOkay , uh that's probably it .\nYeah .\nOkay . So we only ne we only need two for that .\nOkay .\n'Cause I mean these these are moulded . The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it .\nOkay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . And we've got special form  is the one apple .\nRight .\nThe rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be  You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Was that the idea ?\nNe uh\nYeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit .\nMaybe that'll be a second supplement . Then there's a spe a second special form .\nYeah , that\nUh-huh . I would have thought that's probably about r  well .\nUm  Well you got you got twelve .\nOkay , so tha\nSo I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three ,\nRight .\nso we're still within budget on that . Um\nYep , that makes sense .\nSo  decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it ,\nYep .\nbut generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the\nI woulda said so . Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two .\nThat's without   Yeah .\nSo shall we do a  Well , um\nAnd specially it definitely could fits the the real product  What was the  what's the company name ?\nReal Reaction produ\nReal Reactions ?\nR yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nI'm not quite sure , what does that mean ?\nYeah .\nI mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on\nYeah , so  Uh\nYep  I would s\nSo it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be  a different shape . Like we got a cherry one . Maybe other ones could be something else shaped .  I don't know . That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different   seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so\nYou mean of\nUm\nAnd that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well ,\nWell you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change ,\nMm-hmm .\nI don't know .\nbecause at the moment you're making a red apple . So next year you could make  next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon .\nYeah so it's a\nWell you could  Yeah .\nWhatever fruit was in fashion next year .\nYeah , l a lemon lemon or something .\nYeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe .\nAnd that\namount\nOkay . So , we've  what have we what have we rid of . We got rid of the plastic .\nYeah , we've  the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ?\nIs it\nThat  yeah , that was uh\nThe rubber .\nthat was just about all .\nYeah .\nI think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest .\nYeah .\nUm  So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some  maybe lost something on the innovation side ?\nBut uh\nI dunno . And  that is like the most standard type of button .\nSo I mean , we've got  we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe .\nYeah .\nSo , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .\nAnd everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so\nWell , ease has certainly stayed .\nYeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . And what about the sort of innovation ?\nUm , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um\nDo you think   Okay .\nAnd the speech feature .\nYeah , the speech feature .\nAnd then , the corporate identity .\nI think we've cut just about the same . We've maybe lost  Hasn't it  It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect\nHow it would play out , yeah . Oh .\nYeah . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know .\nUm\nI mean , it's maybe not . I mean\nBut I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but\nYeah . Yeah .\nBut either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what\nYeah . Okay , well I mean\nYeah , I don't see how we could make it any more . Um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .\nWe cou Mm-hmm .\nBut then what colour would you make the R_s ?\njust the the company logo . So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off .\nYeah .\nWell , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . So you're  in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo .\nOkay .\nAnd then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on .\nYeah .\nYeah , yeah .\nHey , what what what's the company colour ? Did you get told what the company colour is or\nI'm still not quite sure we've established that .\nNo ,\nDon't think so .\nI just\nBut but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter .\nWe got the logo off the web browser .\nOh right .\nThere's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is ,\nHmm .\nso long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline .\nMm-hmm .\nFact , they've got black and white or black and silver . So basically , even if you had a silver   the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product .\nMm .\nAnd that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .\nOkay . Uh-huh . 'Cause you've got sort of  we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to .\nYou could put in another\nAnother colour .\nWell , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons .\nOr would that be t\nWell , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour .\nYeah . Okay .\nSo you were talking about uh um  We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWhich m may or may not be the case .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nUm\nShall we save the point two for profitability then ?\nWell , yeah . Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?\nUm , I don't think they would really need to be . I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine .\nYeah , maybe we've m\nNeeds to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well .\nMaybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want .\nHmm .\nAnd then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a  plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start .\nYeah . I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume .\nYeah , well\nSo , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important .\nAlright . Okay .\n'Cause you  Yeah .\nYeah .\nSo\nSo we just add that to profitability in effect .\nYeah , I mean so we've dropped the cost , but\nMm-hmm .\nRight , so we're meant to finish up in five minutes .\nSame sort of function ? The criteria ? It's alright .\n'Kay .\nJust made a load of money .\nShouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . 'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all .\nWell , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons .\nAlright .\nle lemon sh\nDid we decide what that was , which button it was ? On the volume ones ?\nI think  well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something .\nRight .\nUh ,  . That's good .\nOr something like that . Yeah .\nDefinitely lemon shaped .\nDid  did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? Or was it the other way around ?\nYou had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I think we can  we're okay .\nRight , okay .\nSo we're okay this way around .\nYeah . So that\nUntil the design team comes in and says , get off .\nso we've saved\nBut you are the design team .\nThen we say it's fine , so it's all good .\nSaved two Euros on that .\nSo what bit are we on to ?\nUm , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? And did we make it a cherry officially ?\nYeah . I th I th\nMm-hmm .\nOh . Right , okay .\nJust in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .\nOh drats , I've botched that , haven't I .\nSo were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?\nWell , we're aiming for um one for all of them .\nRight .\nM but it really has to fit into the budget , so  I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the  Which is fair enough .\nAnd we seem to have  least something in each criteria . We haven't completely left anything out , so\nYeah . Yeah , I think\nAs an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything .\nmost  Yeah . Yep .\nSo do we have anything else to discuss ?\nI don't know . What's on the agenda ?\nRight , okay um  What's happened here ? Right , okay um  Mm  . Right , okay um ,   Right . So we got  So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the  We've done the redesign .\nWe've got the closing .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "rates, rate, kinetic, battery, budget", "dialogue_id": 51}, {"text": "So we're now on to project process .

Yeah .\nWell um\nYeah .\nI thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .\nIndividual meetings . How do you mean ?\nYeah . Well , we were finding out various things in  in be in-between the meetings ,\nIn you on your own .\nand they didn't  the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of  we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons ,\nUm\nand I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of  you'd probably present it at one or something like that .\nMm ,   The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would  normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that .\nYeah .\nThen you go away . You find out information . You then come back . You then discuss it . You then go and change things around ,\nUh-huh .\nand then go back . So\nYeah , I suppose and then  be going out and finding more information each time\nYeah .\nWhereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source ,\nand then diff things will be relevant .\nYeah .\nso it's not uh well uh\nYeah .\nAnyway , so , what do you want to put down ?\nI've put , seemed okay . Creativity , seemed okay . Um um flow of information on on any given subject  given subject um sometimes disjointed .\nYeah .\nI think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing .\nYeah , the thing itself .\nUm\nI can't think of a better example at the minute .\nYeah .\nHave  could have used a different example  pel to increase  create  Creativity .\nYeah .\nIs this go  It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .\nYou have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so\nMm-hmm . Yeah . But  think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . I mean this one seems  . From the website it looks  it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we\nthat's , you know , fifteen quid .\none of those things . Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and\nI th I uh d\nI don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and  have like a brief to kind of\nBut the other thing is that uh they're  I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer\nYeah .\num  for um   you  normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed .\nMm-hmm .\nSo what she's doing is she's  having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . And then you  or the idea is that the  whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to  either give them directly  give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever . So uh , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um  to enable it to work . And of course , you had the machine crashing\nHmm .\nYeah .\nand various things going wrong . So\nWell , sh  we look at the last slide ,\nMm-hmm .\nsee if it's got anything else .\nAlright ,\nI think there's one one more to go .\nso we've got uh\nYeah .  I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge .\nNew ideas found ,\nAnd\ndid we find any , no .\nIt was quite good with this um  the white board , having that and the digital pens .\nAlright .\nLike , that's something that made it a little easier .\nYeah . Yeah .\nLeadership , teamwork .\nwe did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . I've never seen one of them before .  batteries , I think . So\nDoes\nvoice recognition , especially not  could\nYou've got voice recognition computers ,\nMm yeah .\nthat's not remote controls .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWell it's a different application of it .\nMm-hmm . Okay ,\nYeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .\nso how do you reckon teamwork went ?\nMm .\nUm\nThat went okay , yeah .\nYeah , I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm , yeah .\nTo uh go uh reasonably well . Okay .\nI don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything\nBit  bit arbitrary .\nWell , I mean I don't think it  I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know , high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens ,\nMm-hmm .\nand uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in .\nSo , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .\nSurely they they should produ\nAnd and new i new ideas found was the the other thing .\nWell leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it .\nYeah .\nBut we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager .\nYou were the leader .  So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours .\nYeah . Yeah .\nNow , I'd much rather be in marketing\nbut    I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked .\nHowever , um  Alright uh means , so whiteboard um  so really , it's uh equipment . Oh .\nYeah . It worked .\nYeah , very nice .\nComput computers could be a bit difficult at times but\nBut I mean , I d I don't  I'm not sure I see the value in these . I mean , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? Do you plug  the computer or something ?\nI think there's a little there's a little um chi\nSo it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so\nThere's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something\nShould we quickly look at the last slide ?\nand it produces a\nSh\nRight .

And finally in this meeting we have to decide\nand we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's uh little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up  so I'll handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept .\nOkay .

Yeah .\nThe next one .\nRight here , is that little  that one , yes please .\nThank you .\nI'll take the mouse .  So uh\nwe were looking he specifically at the components uh  the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition ,\nyou have to have microphone  well no you don't actually I haven't  have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way\nit has to it has to hear the speaker\nMm-hmm .\nand um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Um so the other w thing that we  So . Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um  we wanted to evaluate some new materials\nand we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might  come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um  our research .\nSo um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .\nCourse , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh  we can really seriously explore ,\nso then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor\nand th um there might be some  problems with the m uh how it's   uh goes with the board .  Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle  it gets brittle after a while ,\nso um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh ,\nthe m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how  Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood .\nAt least it's environmentally friendly .\nSo ,  this is our finding .\nAnd a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we're  we're  currently uh proposing ,\nuh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second .\nSo then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board ,\nuh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . And um then there was the regular which  I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print ,  and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender ,\nwhich w 'member the beam was  that was an important component of finding the right chip .\nAnd uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um ,\nyou know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a  this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research\nand my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ?\nCan you go back uh one slide ?\nI'm not sure , how do I  Oh , I know , let's see .\nThank you . Yeah .\nLet's go back up here .\nYes , uh  question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ?\nI think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um  and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board .\nMm-hmm .\nUh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting .\nYeah , is it means it's on the  yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh\nI don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting .\nOkay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good .\nSounds good .\nWhy was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?\nBecause um it gets brittle , cracks\nMm-hmm .\nUm We want  we expect these um  uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . So .  Good ex   Good expression .\nWhic\nWow ,\nWhich\ngood expression . Well after us .\nI don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while .\nAlthough I think\nI think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , I mean it chips , it if you drop it ,\nuh it's  I'm not su\nSo  so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes .\nyou're what ?\nActually , I'm ready to sell it .\nI think  if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work ,\nI'm ready to sell it .\nYou think ?  And you could  you could sell oils with it , to take care of it .\nbut you can't just use\nNo y  no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood ,\nYeah , exactly , yeah .\nbut there are some very pretty woods out there  .\nWell I'm glad you\nThat's actually very innovative idea .\nOkay , good .\nSorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face .\nWell , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .\nMm-hmm .\nThe stain .\nI mean it's  each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market .\nMm .\nYeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ?\nUm , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own\nYes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first\nIn turns of wow .\nShe works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this  .\nY yeah .\nLuckily Ed was not .\nWood ?\nI think we can get the quality materials then  it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation .\nOne thing we'd have to check though is what the users  whether  how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh\nMm-hmm . Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your\nYeah , for example .  So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that ,\nIt's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it   for teething .\nbut\nThey do that anyway with the rubber and plastic ,\nYeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah .\nso  , and chew 'em up . And chew 'em up .\nOkay then , uh , let's move to Agnes .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentation, presentations, powerpoint, meeting, slide", "dialogue_id": 52}, {"text": "Sure .\nOh , I'm sorry .\nS you're\nYou are in participant three .\nOne point three , yeah\nUh , yeah .\nThis one ?\nI think so , yeah . Yeah , that's the one . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of\nI took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .\nRight , my hand is uh different size than yours for example .\nSo , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones ,\nso that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd also  um you had issues with the batteries running out ,\nso I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is  starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition .\nMm-hmm .\nSo , in terms of what this thing would actually look like\nDespite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me .   You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad .  And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_\nand on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you .\nMm . Mm-hmm .\nUm , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip  thing and  Have I forgotten anything ? I don't think so . So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design ,\nNo .\nwhich is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .\nA hinge . Be like a copper hinge or you know .\nYeah . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy .\nMm-hmm . Mm .\nBut that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably ,  you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nHmm .\nSo , that's pretty much  all I had to say , I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . Um the centering of the key pad and  the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control ,\nMm-hmm .\nthe number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently .\nMm . Mm-hmm .\nSo once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines .\nSo what's your , uh , the comments or uh s\nSimple design . It's what consumers want .\nOkay\nIt's almost like , Houston , we have a product here .\nProblem is obviously gonna be cost .\nMm-hmm .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "controls, customising, layout, presentation, customi", "dialogue_id": 52}, {"text": "Okay , I also have a f  very simple presentation ,\nMm-hmm .\nbecause for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI also have uh copied a different type of remote . If you can find me , where I'm at .  There should only be one in here .  trend watch .\nSure .\nIt's being modified .\nThey're stealing our product .  We've been giving simple  questionnaires in different areas because th  obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . Uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh .\nNo ,\nNo , no .\nf go to findings .\nNo no , no no .  'Cause I had another comment there . Uh the market trend . This is what we know from the last uh  from the  questionnaires from the the  all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing ,\nwe have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become  has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they  look  it looks and feels good and has technology . The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design .  The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use .\nThe first one , I see  that they put in a display . Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked .\nYeah .\nMaybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display\nContext-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in .\nRight .\nOkay Because I've seen  mostly the standard ones ,\nEspecially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and\nyeah . Now you have it  now you have one with the very simple also . The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing .\nMm-hmm .\nSo maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good ,  uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours\nMm-hmm .\nYou know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um  a uh  uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball ,\n, we might've\nOh yeah .\nand then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .\nYeah , so it's really molded to to your specific\nTo t  an and then you would know like  um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh\nMm-hmm .\nHow hard they squeeze ?\nYes  you'd know what kind of wood to get .\nResistance resistance , right .\nBut th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if  unless everyone has their own personal remote .\nThat's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that .

So\nOkay .\nopening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion .  And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece  and a long-life battery or a charging station . Okay , now three presentations . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials  um and then the conceptual specification of user interface  and finally trend watching .\nThat would be me .\nYep .\nAlright . Well .\nMm . 'kay . Function F_ eight it . There we go .\nAlright . Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . Components design . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of .  Um . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . That would be our case . Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels ,\nMm .\nwhich can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen .  Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . We're talking about long-life batteries here .  Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um  using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . Or a solar battery , although there are slight um  complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery .\nHmm .\nOr um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you .  So those are our options . Um personal preferences that I was thinking through  here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . And we wanna go for simplicity . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything\nMm .\nany ideas on that ? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery .  Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light .\nBut this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . That's what I have for options . Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing .\nIs double-curved like  would be like two hands kind of thing ?\nI'm not sure . I haven't received any specific\nOkay .\nvisuals of this yet .\n'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve\nThis is what I'm sort of\nand then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing ,\nYeah . I'm not sure ,\nbut I've no idea .\nbut I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures .\nSounds good .\nYeah , I wonder\nI know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . But the titanium , they were quite  they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting .\nSpace-age remote .\nMm-hmm .  Just an interesting marketing kind of element .\nJust all things to keep in mind . Yeah .  That's about all I have to do , guys . I hope I didn't go through that too quickly .\nUh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you\nYeah , n\nno idea , okay .\nno idea , no idea . Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight ,\nMm-hmm .\nand that a tita titanium is very light , I know ,\nMm-hmm .\num but other than\nthat's really basic , I mean , that's all I have gotten so far .\nOkay .\nAlright ? Any other questions ?\nUh-huh . Don't think so .\nNo ? Okay .\nMm 'kay .\nI have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look\nThank you , perfect .\nand I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . Uh\nThanks .\nUm if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um  underneath our  oh , uh in your book ,\nJust in my notebook ,\nthen don't worry about that .\nbut if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . Alright ? Uh I guess I can\n'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface .\nYeah , um . This one's so much tighter than the other one .\nI know .\nOkay . Nope . There we go . Here you are .\nJess .\nG oh , geez .\nAlright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable . Um other  we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include  that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work ,\nhow how  what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . And of course we also have to make it look cool .\nSo basically ,\nthat's what we don't want .  M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . We want something that looks nice and simple .\nHmm .\nHere's a a fairly simple device . This is an an iPod from Apple . Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . It's very minimalistic in its design . Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . Um  the thing I like about this is that it's very very quick to access the main features . Uh you can just about make out uh that the button  three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um  here's a another example . This is uh  it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . Um it's certainly got novelty value .\nMm .\nUh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of  yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . So I  I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . Um but these are these are all necessary functions . Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device .\nHmm .\nAnd that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often .\nOkay .\nSo you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ?\nI think that's  that's one way to go , yes .\nOkay .\nUm I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's  it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair .\nMm-hmm .\nThere are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're  I\nRight\nwell we're  I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark ,\nMm-hmm .\nRight .\nbut you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . The alternative is to have a  an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your  this thing of watch lo what's on each channel .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nI mean that that's also a good idea . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nUh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make .\n'Kay .\nI do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on .\nUm and so\nYeah .\nlike favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's  um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it .\nWell  Are you are you tak\nLike I I know I use that often enough .\nYeah .\nWait , but is that separate from what he was saying ?\nWell\nYeah .\nif it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a\nNo , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on .\nOkay .\nYeah , that that would be one of the features , yes .\nOkay . 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box ,\nBut it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way ,\nmm-hmm .\nso you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can .\nOh , good point .\nMm .\nUm I'm not sure .\nYeah .\nOkay , now we're moving on to market . Marketing .\nShould I plug that in ?\nIs that going on ? Okay .\nMaybe it's just not\nUh that should be alright , actually .\nIs it on ? Ri What F_ do you have to press ,\nEight .\nfive ? I just keep pressing lots of 'em . Well , I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be .  If anything , the  that they gave me .\nOops , it's not plugged in , quite in well enough .\nNo signal .\nAlright .\nThere we are .\nOop , there we go .\nMm 'kay .\nOh yeah .  Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching .  Basically , I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year .\nSo first um they had people  they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one ,\nOkay .\nso just to take that weight into account .  The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . I don't know how much we agree with that .  And then  the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes ,\nshoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy ,  tight material .\nS sweet .\nAnd so that brings us to my personal preferences . Who wants a spongy remote or one with  fruit and vegetable padding .\nPersonally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so\neven though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily  wanna take away .\nAlso , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to  like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most .  But  it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material .\nMm .\nThat  there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though .\nYeah .  I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them ,\nthat pretty much sums it up . So yeah .\nOkay , do we have any  s some questions for this , let's see um .\nYeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ?\nUm do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ?\nLike could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands .\nIf it's latex  if it's latexy\nIt's kind of  and then it\nUm , mean\nwe would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that ,\nA kind of thing that\nI dunno . But\nAn uh I  if  th  my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . It's  there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to  R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things\nMm-hmm .\nand and\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah ,\nYeah , so something , m m instead of a necess\nsomething grippable , I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe .\nyeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nyou know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle ,\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nso that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called .\nYeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's  that seems doable .  could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them ,\nF for sure , or maybe like\nli\num couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something .\nThe buttons could be fruit-shaped .\nCould they be smelly ?\nI Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something .\nOh well\nOh God .\nI don't know .\nOr carrot shaped ,\nit's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot\nmm .\nisn't it ?\nMaybe ,\nLike large button ,\nOr maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits .\nor\nthat's what I was thinking of , yeah .\nWhat about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit .\nbe\nKind of like a potato .\nyeah .\nYeah .\nMight\nIt'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think .\nwould you think you you  do you think you'd be able to hold it ?\nJust to tie it in a little .\n'Cause I think the reason they're long is  yeah .\nIt'd be harder to press button .\nHarder to push .\nDepends . When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? Or your fingers ?\nYeah .\nUm\nI usually hold it in one hand . Maybe\nI\nOr maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb .\nBut then the buttons would have to be very small .\nYeah , that's ts how I tend to do it .\nDon't you think ?\nNo\nYeah ,\njust thumb-sized .\n'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around .\nJus\nBut I mean in order to get to all of them ,\nBut I like i\nyou know .\nYeah  .\nThey would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other .\nYeah .\nMaybe .\nThat's true .\nBut if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps .\nRight . I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel .\nand  And you find that works quite well ?\nI love the idea of the wheel like the iPod .\nYeah\nMm-hmm .\nIs that\n'Cause th\nThe button on an iPod , is it  what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ?\nIt's like five ,\nIt's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel .\nIt  wel well\n'cause there's one in the middle .\nyeah , it would  I mean each version of it has been a little bit different ,\nThe one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think .\nbut  Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . Ts and you press the centre button ,\nRight .\nthat's that's your all-purpose select button right there .\nOh , I see , right , yeah . Oh , okay .\nSince it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah .\nYeah , that's quite a good design .\nI think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume .\nYeah .\nLike just the idea of like those\nUh uh\nso few buttons for main things ,\nt\nbut then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ ,\nYeah .\n'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ?\nHmm .\nMm .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd then you could still have that available .\nYeah , I think an  L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .\nI think it could be difficult in practice ,\nYeah .\nyeah . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_\nRight .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nand people don't wanna do that .\nUm", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "designing, design, presentations, meeting, functional", "dialogue_id": 53}, {"text": "Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left ,\nOh we probably have to get going , don't we ?\nso I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation . Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this  these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all\n'Kay .\nbefore we move on .  Um\nCould  Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours ,\nIf I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know .\nLike , to make it different fruits .\nyeah .\nYeah , it's possible .\nYeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex\nExactly .\nwherea but the actual model could be titanium .\nAnd you could co-ordinate with your house  or whatever . All these options .\nI think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel .\nOoh .\nSo instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside .\nWell ,\nAh hmm hmm hmm .\nOh .\nDon't know .\nthere we go . The iPod packaging is me like was so  that was like half the fun .\nYeah .\nIt's like the way it all comes all cute .\nMm . Options .\nLemons ?\nOkay , um\ncomponents concept . Energy , chip on print .\nUh-hu oh , oh yes .\nG\nRight , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get  be necessary but um\nThat's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So can you just explain what that is real quick ?\nAlright , so um decisions , what the  okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery .\nMm-hmm .\nUm I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?\nI think it's awesome . I think it's really cool .\nAm I  Yeah .\nYeah , I mean , it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries .\nYeah .\nYeah , um I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is ,\nRight , I haven't gotten any\nbut as far as I know , the technology is good .\nCosts .\nyeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think .\nBut over time\nUm circuit boards . Um yeah , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . They're  they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us .\nI don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done .\nOkay .\nUm yeah , I can't can't really tell you . I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . But I don't know any decisions on\nIf they're if they're really options .\nYeah . I'm sorry ,\nOkay .\nI did f\nAl all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . Uh it's fairly fairly standard .\nYeah .\nUm okay , then we'll move on to the case . Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe .\nRight . Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . Um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that . Um ,  'kay , the pushbutton  if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ?\nUm I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . I mean it might be nice for changing the volume .\nIt would be nice for changing the volume ,\nOh .\nUh but\nbut I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 'Cause you don't have control over numbers\nI don't think it would really work .\nYeah , it's a\nor\nYeah ,\nYeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel .\nth it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll .\nBut if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWe have five minutes left for the meeting , so .\nand the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as  I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nAnd otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no  it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nSo , have a scroll for volume ?\nF or for all those secret functions ?\nF\nWhen you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus .\nI think  yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . Um\nRight . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending  and maybe we could table that decision for later .\nUm .\nI don't know .\nI think w well  I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide  the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not .\nOkay . Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case .\nOkay , let's do case .\nUh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing .\nYeah .\nI'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside .\nOkay .\nUm\nOh could it be hard , and then something around it ?\nUh yeah , everything I've\nYeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing .\nN oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that  there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex .\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nNot too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that .\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nThe inside is hard . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board ,\nGe o\nI think that that's done for us .\nOkay .\n'Kay . Yeah .\nSo we uh we do want latex .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay . Latex . Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours .\nYeah .\nFruity colours .  Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose .\nOh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ?\nWell , we don't really know what the difference is , right ?\nI'm thinking curved of some sort .\nYeah .\nYeah , okay .\nYeah .\nWe don't really know what the difference\nUm okay , interface , the type and the supplements . So push or scroll ,\nUm\nright ? Or both ?\nYep . Um  And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button .\nGood point .\nSo in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons .\nMm-hmm . And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things .\nYeah , yeah , it's uh  it's it's fairly simple .\nI think that  yeah . For channel surfing I think a scroll  an actual  like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno .\nYeah . I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nIs that okay with you ?\nbecause\nHow you feeling ?\nYeah . And let's like see if we get anything else . I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .\nIt might be cool enough .\nYeah .\nOkay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , and then supplements ,\nYep .\nhow are we gonna do that ?\nUh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ?\nUm I assume that's what else we're gonna  like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use .\nUm\nSo we're gonna have like a menu button ,\nOh .\nso that we can access on-screen things then ?\nYep . Yeah .\nOkay , um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through .\nAlright .\nUm in\nSo what are what are our buttons gonna be ?\nYeah . On off ,\nOn off\nuh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu .\nSo like one through five , or\nYeah , yeah\nLike a radio type sorta situation ?\nabout  yeah like  yeah , a bit like radio presets . Um\nPre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , right ?\nUh we wouldn't even need the numbers .\nNo .\nI think maybe numbers seems  is kind of old-fashioned .\nWell , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through .\nYeah , yeah , you can just\nMm .\nand you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button ,\nYeah , up down .\nbut the volume control could double for that , for example .\nMm-hmm . Okay , um finishing the meeting now . Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes ,\num you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach .\nOoh .\nCool .\nWow .\nUm did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ?\nSimple chip .\nOkay .\nYep .\nWe are done .

So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts ?\nOkay ,  .\nSo marketing .\nSo you are  you saved your y your presentation somewhere ?\nYep .\nSo you're four ?\nFour , yeah .\nWhich is trend watch .  Okay . Mr Marketing Experts .\nYeah that's me .\nSo\nUh . Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users . Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current the n current trends ?\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah ? Okay .   Okay .  Well wha  what I found  um can you\nNext slide ? Yeah .\nYeah . Thank you . What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most  what they what they find more more interesting , more  or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel .\nSo now more more cool aspect , ma more  a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with  instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .\nOkay .\nUh also  Well  in in Euro in in Paris and and  Milan the\nin Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of  uh of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's  it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables .\nMm .\nAnd also  in the in the U_S_A_ the the current  the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . Spongy means eponge ?\nMm-hmm .\nSo maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so\nWhat what do you mean by  fruit and vegetables and spongy ?\nWhat  you mean clothe\nSpongy means it it's like sp\nFruit vegetables is the the new  have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ?\nNo , I missed that one .\nYeah , I I didn't miss an\nI didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .\nOh , they're  okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay .\nNo no , not not yet , not yet .\nYeah , yeah .\nSo we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana ,\nSo te textu textures , yeah .\njust maybe\nYeah .\nVegetable textures and all this kind .\nDrawings of bananas .\nUh\nOkay and\nUh-huh .\nyeah , yeah .\nBut what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ?\nWell so this is in the next slide certainly .\nUh no no , it's not .\nIt's not ?\nIt's\nSo which fruit are you thinking of ?\nAnd  Um .\nI ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may  could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something .\nMm-hmm .\nBut yeah it it depends on the\nSo maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ .\nOh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit ,\nor you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the\nMeans buttons are in the shape of fruits ,\nYeah maybe the shape the shape\nbuttons are in the frape  shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that .\nNo , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different .\nApple for channel one .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nSo we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend\nSo something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant .\nbut  For instance , yeah . African or as an elephant ?\nThat we can discuss afterwards  .\nOkay .\nBut  okay ,\nI'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is .\nWell ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices\nTo fruit ?\nand also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was  was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control .\nBut is it uh is fruit cool ?\nWhat ?\nThat's a question .\nWhat ?\nIs fruit cool ?\nYeah ? Uh  Is the new trend of the\nWell I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so ,  imagi\njust 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool .\nNo I think we we should think about a a shape with it  a device with a shape of some\nOkay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , you don't wanna pear or a watermelon .\nYeah . Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ?\nWell , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of ,\nBanana .\na cucumber .\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe too long .\nI dunno .\nOr m\nMaybe . Too green .\nMaybe .\nSo , but I mean you also have to  you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and  you know .\nA banana .\nUm\nIt's , it\nYeah .\nThe thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like  on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build .\nI don't th it will be rolling a lot .\nYeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so\nOkay . Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough  a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also .\nYeah .\nUh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ?\nWell , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not .\nWell , this is\nI think  Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation ,\nso , I will give more importance to the look and feel than  rather than the\nSo  So you you you suggest to go f\nnew inputs and also it's  I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need  buying control remote , buying uh\nOkay .  S so you're simply\nmore things . It's not so simple .\nyou're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons  with only a few buttons .\nFor instance , yeah . Yeah for for for  given an an example yeah .\nOkay good .

Thanks . Um . Okay , I'll give the floor . So you are User Interface guy . So you're three ?\nOkay . Yeah .\nAnd it's this one .\nYep .\nGo for it .\nYep . Okay . So . S next uh slide . Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control  .\nBut it's just a speaker right ?\nIt's  no , what it is , it's it's very\nIt's not a microphone .\nIt has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it's got a little chip and it allows you t\nMm-hmm . Actually I'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it  just to speak to you .\nWell , it's a sample sensor sample speaker . Sample sensor sample speaker . It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nBut uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . So , I mean , you know ,\nOkay .\nI guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nBut basically the thing is , we have this technology available\nIn-house .\nin-house . So , um\nMm-hmm .\nbut the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components ,\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nso um it it  but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nWhilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it ,\nI  there's something that I  unclear really understanding . Is this a technology that recognize keywords  speech keywords ?\nIt's it it's no , well , it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . You train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase , you say  the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um  well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ?\nAnd it's just to , it's just to playback something ?\nYeah . So actually that was a bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so .\nYeah yeah . So this is not s really to do to to do control .\nOnly , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an\nYeah . This is just more like a poi pois yeah .\nIt's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing ,\nYeah yeah .\nbut I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh\nSo it it's c uh it it\nYeah but you can u\nit is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to  we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh\nCompletely pointless yeah .\nyeah comp  completely pointless  for the inter for  from the interaction point of v point of view  .\nYeah . Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control .\nOkay .\nYeah but the  can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ?\nWell yeah , that's the thing , if  you can but  you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it .\nYeah yeah . So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it .\nSo\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , that would be some development work .\nSo this is out of discussion . So if if if it is something that you can  we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control\nYeah .\nM Mando .\nBanana-mando .\nNo this is mm banana-bando , yeah .\nBanana-man\nBanana-mando yeah .\nUh then it could be cool yeah .\nYeah okay , let's go ahead .\nOkay .\nI uh I I I don't think it's worth it though , I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so\nOkay .\nUm , yeah . So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our  potential funky-looking uh remote control\nIt doesn't look like a banana at all .\nWell , you see , I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus ,\nYeah .\num , so at the moment it's more of a box focus .\nBut you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to\nLooks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit .\nYeah .\nYeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes .\nYeah .\nBut um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know ,\nStable thing , that's right . To have  ,\nI think everyone has has agreed that it's  that it could be quite a useful um thing , so .\nmm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nBut I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume ,\nMm .\nbecause it's it's  the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nBut um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and  well\nWhat's a turbo button ?\nso this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh  Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing  .\nIt con it controls the speed ?\nYeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going  if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever .\nSo yeah , that's um , those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana\nIt's enough .\nand it's still very  it may even be for most  for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , um  you know , what other buttons do we want ?\nMm-hmm .\nI mean we could have  well , I guess you need an on and off switch ,\nSwitch on . Yeah .\nbut you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing .\nYeah . So sounds crazy . I like crazy ideas .\nThat's why you're a marketing guru .\nOkay .\nYeah , of course .\nSo i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing .\nWell , that's the thing , as  have we decided that we can only spend , uh , twenty five Euro ?\nI think that\nWell not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro .\nI I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so .\nNo we can we can't use that .\nYou  we can ? We can't .\nWe can't use that to to comman co communicate ,\nCommunicate .\nit's just a thing\nYeah , but we can say channel twenty five .\nIt's one way .\nNo .\nNo ?\nBut then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , you have to be able to to recognize\nMm-hmm .\nIt's not a lot one hundred templates ,\nMm . Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our  can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning .\nit's not\nYeah .\nAh , it's designed for a cof  okay . Is it design for a coffee machine ?\nWell that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so .\nOkay .  Yeah . Maybe you could ask your  the  you could ask the engineering department if we can\nYeah . A good good good thing .\nMm-hmm .\nYou want to g to move to your slides ?\nBut uh\nYeah , that's right , yeah .\nYou're finished ?\nWell I just I just made the point , I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment .\nYeah I think so .\nBut um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about um being able to find the remote control\nYeah .\nand I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well .\nMm-hmm .\nIt might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote .\nMm .\nY in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition  the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here\nExactly yeah .\nbut uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping\nSo it's a speech synthesis kind of thing ,\nIt's speech\nsomething has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out .\nIt's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , yeah\nMm-hmm .\nOh , good idea .\nYeah . That's right .\nVery good .\nyeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "microphone, conversation, speaker, dialogue, speech", "dialogue_id": 54}, {"text": "Okay , let's move on . So you're two ?\nThat's right .\nOkay .\nSo this is going to be about the component design .\nMm-hmm .\nSo first thing is we need power source for the remote control . So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your  if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t\nI guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy .\nYeah .\nYeah . So there should  we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them .\nSo , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure\nDouble curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is .\nOkay , but like , kind of convex or concave ?\nSo , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nSo there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves .\nOkay .\nThese are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one ,\nYeah .\nit'll bring the cost down\nAlthough , you know , wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option ,\nand anyway it's\nif you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on .\nMm but i but there is no elasticity which could be\nWooden cases\nWell it depends , I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken ,\nYeah but the components inside .\nit's the inside . Yeah but inside you know you could have  you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nVery  too expensive to do .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nAnd also uh\nAnd I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well .\nYeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood .\nThat's true , but are we set on the banana idea ?\nWell it look like\nActually\nit looks like you are all targeting that\nI was thinking that the\nyeah ?\nthe shape of a banana is not it's not really handy .\nYes it is .\nUh I don't know the name o o in English uh   This\nIs it an e apple which has\nit's not a fruit it's a vegetable .\nIt's like a pumpkin or\nYeah ? Pumpkin .\nGreen .\nGreen .\nGreen .\nUm um um , yes I see .\nWhat does it taste like ?\nAnd you put in the salad .\nPep pepperoni .\nAh yeah ,\nUm\nis it  what's it in French ?\nPoivron .\nOui c'est ca\nYeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . Yeah .\nUh pepper .\nPepper .\nBut um they do d\nAnd it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of\nYeah .\nI don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like\nYeah .\nNo , I mean in a\nIt's not re it\nlike with a banana you can have\nyou you think it's really fancy and fun ? You think that young people that are\nI'm sure it's fun .\nYeah . More than a banana ?\nBut banana is not so handy ,\nWell\nBanana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum .\nI think that's handier .\nBut  like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top\nYeah .\nand just roll it back and forth like that ,\nIt's kind it's kind of  it's more uh\nbut with uh  I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and\nit's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to  to put the controls .\nOkay let's move on .\nYeah you're right .\nSo time is running , let's move on .\nOkay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just  and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that .\nOkay .\nYeah , we can go to the next slide . Then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . So we can have regular chip for control . Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . And uh regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced .\nSo is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of\nIt could be a beep kind of thing .\nOkay , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ?\nYes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip ,\nOkay .\nmost most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that .\nOkay . So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ?\nThat will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . It should be  whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside .\nOkay . Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker .\nMm-hmm . Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .\nYeah .\nAs  or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place ,\nYeah . So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside .\nso that  That's right . Okay . Yeah . So these these were the component selection and these things . We can go to the next slide . And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device  wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .\nAlthough , if  It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device .\nMm . Of fruits .\nCause that , you know , that  sometimes people like to collect um you know things that  of a similar type .\nMm-hmm .\nS objects .\nRemotes  objects , okay .\nCrazy objects .\nI think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits .\nWell ,  you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place .\nNo but I think just one fruit to control everything .\nLike a power fruit .\nA power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit  .\nAnd uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s\nOkay .\nYeah .\nand we should have it on the remote .\nOkay , good .\nWell\nActually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control .\nSo you're having a basis station . Okay . Your  usually your remote sits on that . So you  and it's  that's why it can have chargeable batteries . Now let's say\nSo you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station .\nBu it's it's  .\nBasis station is with the thing .\nYou s you you  thing .\nIt's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh\nI think that's a pretty handy feature .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI think it's kind of  people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nSo\nYeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget .\nUh this is  basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits .\nMm-hmm .\nAlthough you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote .\nThat's right . But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems .\nSo component cost is going to be the least . Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly .\nOkay . I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I  this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like  it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana ,\nAnd\nbut what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . And um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch .  For better  want of a better word\nYou think that yellow it's kitsch .\nyou know ?\nMm-hmm .\nWell , you know , I don I don't know how many peop\nIf you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana .\nYeah . No , I I\nA  yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then .\nWell they\nO otherwise\nMaybe li like that .\nIt's neither a banana nor a\nYeah , like this colour this colour  Maybe , you know , maybe  like still in the shape of a banana .\nRoughly .\nNo , exactly .\nExactly . Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know  because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make  um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies .\nYeah . Okay . Let's move on .\nAnd uh going to the last slide .\nUh uh  yeah . Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype .\nOkay .\nGo for it .\nOkay .\nWell no , not not you , you can finish your slides before\nOkay . Okay , so . Anyway , users'll be  so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes .\nMm  okay .\nSo that was very  I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody .\nOkay .\nThat's it .\nThat's all ?\nYep .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remotes, controls, remote, buttons, prototype", "dialogue_id": 54}, {"text": "Okay , so mm  so well done for the presentations . So we need to take some de decisions about um  about what we're going to do .\nSo I I propose that you go to the whiteboard\nYeah .\nand we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product\nOkay .\nand uh where Superman go banana and uh\nuh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order  not to lost the um the device ,\nMm-hmm .\nI do I don't remember you call it ?\nThat's right . The basis station . That's right .\nBasis station , yeah . Uh so um  so we're going for a stylish banana shape .\nYeah , so , I guess you wanna hold  like the way  the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than  'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor .\nYeah , right .\nSo you know , so if you have like\nWhat about what about this shape ? More or less .\nWe\nThere's less space on this to put with the buttons .\nI if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could\nYeah , but how many buttons do we need ?\nthe the starting is good but it could  it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult  if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . So ti time is running ,\nUh what about a\nwe have to we have to we have to to move forward . So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . Yeah .\nOkay , so\nSo we have this .\nSo\nWe have a a basis um , how do you call it  ?\nThe base station .\nA base station .\nRight .\nWe'll have a base station extra uh on the side .\nokay , so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nUh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping .\nThat's right , yeah , we need that , yeah .\nWe need b R_F_ to beep .\nOkay , so it's uh\nSo we  that means we need a button on th on the on the basis .\nYeah .\nBasis station .\nBasis station , thank you .\nYeah , yeah .\nAlright , so we need uh  okay .\nCan you go quickly please ?\nYeah .\nOkay .  So we are going to add uh also um you  as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button .\nYeah . Yeah , which  I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device ,\nTurbo button .\nYeah , on the th yeah , maybe here .\nso you have\nAnd the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance .\nYes . Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here .\nAnd and you have two wheels .\nSo yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel .\nOkay right . Good . So no L_C_D_ .\nAnd , uh  No L_C_D_ .\nOkay great .  Um .  Very good .\nOh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nUh for the remote ?\nYeah .\nOh , just the switch ,\nRemotes don't have power on off switch .\nno f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ . Uh so you\nYeah .\nOkay . S no , that'll be controlled by the  those buttons'll be there already , yeah .\nWhat a\nWhere ?\nMeans on the remote .\nOn the side .\nOkay .\nBecause remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . They are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this .\nWell , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote in the first place , you know .\nOh , yeah . That's that's another issue which I didn't think of .\nY I mean you need to kind of keep it um\nBut you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make .\nWhat about\nYeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ? I can't remember ,\nTwenty five .\nTwenty five .\nTwelve point five is the profit on one .\nYeah , but how many units did we need to to sell  ?\nUh forty th four . Point point four million ?\nFour millions ?\nFour point four million .\nPoint four million .\nThat's a lot of fruit .\nIn the market .\nWhat about a\nYeah . So . Well . No . Time is running , we have to close the meeting in a few minutes .\nOkay .\nSo , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat .\nOkay .\nThe next step is to go for   to f is to go to uh to building a prototype , based on this , okay ?\nOkay .\nSo next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype .\nMm-hmm .\nUh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation .\nOkay ?\nI wo what about adding the  this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying  volume up volume down ?\nIt's too difficult .\nIt's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few  five words .\nIt's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so t it's  in the next prototype so let's skip it .\nUh .\nOkay .\nFor the future prototypes .\nYeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one .\nThat can be the t That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando .\nYeah yeah , honour the fruit .\nPlus plus , okay . Maybe objective banana ?\nOkay .\nThanks very much . We'll see n next meeting . Bye .\nOkay .\nSo meeting's over ?\nYep . We have to go design the prototype .\nOkay . Okay . Okay .

Yeah ,\ncows .\nThat's a great elk .\nUh-oh , we have a good artist .\nThat is really good .\nThanks .\nYeah .\nI'm quite\nThis is my\nOh , very shapely .\nOkay .\nBrilliant .\nThat's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature ,\nthat um , that um\nIn a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh\nBut it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself .\nMm .\nYeah .\nVery nice . Okay .\nRight .\nRight , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals .\nOkay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently .\nOh .\nOh .\nIt's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind .\nNot as artistic as Heather's drawing .\nBit more cartoon style .\nBut I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and  they just know what they're doing .\nUh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . They know what they want .\nBasically , that's why I like cats .\nVery good .\nGreat .\nI'll rub that out . There you go .\nOkay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure  how to draw one .\nOoh .\nI , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes  and they're really easy to draw .\nUm ,\nI forget her name .\nright it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog .\nTara\nor Tara .\nWell there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog .\nIt's a cartoon dog I think .\nA s I don't ev Oh , oh well .  It's a scary cartoon dog . That  This ,\nthat does not look like a dog .\nIt looks kinda like a person .\nWe can pretend .\nI'm sorry .\nThat's Pinocchio .\nHow do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . Right . Yous know what it's supposed to be .\nOkay .\nIt's a dog .  . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . And , like they're more of a companion than cats .\nYeah , that's true .\nI've nothing against cats . Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them .\nBut they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals ,\nthat don't look like that .\nAlrighty . I feel like a robot .\nOkay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . At first I thought it was a dead leaf .\nAnd then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda  there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this .\nIt's kinda like a peacock .\nYeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was  This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March .\nSo I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah .\nVery nice .\nThere you go .\nGreat .\nUh , what do we  Oh .\nDo you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?\nYes I do .\nYea  Right .\nSo , now that we know how to use the whiteboard ,\nOkay .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "animal, animals, whiteboard, moose, elk", "dialogue_id": 55}, {"text": "um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um  or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um  selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can  like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents .\nOkay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty .\nI'm bad at math .\nOkay .\n'Kay .  Um ,\nso now that , um , that is underway , um\nit is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . Does anyone have any initial thoughts ?\nI find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing .\nMm-hmm . So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ?\nOkay .\nUm\nI always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing .\nIt's always , where is the remote control ?\nYeah .\nSo maybe if you could have some kind of tracking  device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was .\nI dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall ,  signal ,\nYeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea .\n'cause it always gets lost .\nDo yous not find that , um ,  like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , that you don't use half of them .\nYeah , I don't know what they do .\nMm-hmm . There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something .\nYeah .\nYeah , that's , that's\nThat's useful .\nYeah , it is . Yeah .\nSo you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAlright . Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like\nAny ideas will do that you have at this point .\nMm .\nCould be shaped like a conch ,\nCan hold it .\nA novelty .\nyou know . Be like a shell-shaped remote .\nYeah .\nAre we going into kind of novelty factors here .

Mm-hmm .\nYeah .\nbut at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there .\nYeah . I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable\nYeah .\n.\nMm-hmm .\nBut we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either .\nYeah .\nSo , hmm .\nAnd the key issue here is , is being trendy and original .

Maybe you can presen\nF between o one and seven .\nokay . Maybe   hold it .\nSo I think it's uh very uh very nice . What do you think ?\nI give it a  I give it a five .\nYeah . So it's between one and seven ? Seven is the highest uh ?\nYeah .  Seven is the\nI will give a six .\nI will give a a five .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd you ?\nsorry .\nDo you vote uh Christine ?\neh ?\nDo you also vote ?\nNo , I just want to see something\nMaybe we all have to agree on a common\nWell , we can  very easily  .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nUh I think uh   and need to  as well  .\nNo problem .

Yeah .\nOkay , let's say that seven is the best .\nOr maybe we can say s seven is the best mm  .\nOkay . So so do note the grade we have five , six for me ,\nFive .\nfive . And what what's your choice ?\nOh sorry .\nHow much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?\nSix  Uh s you can  how much what ?\nHow much would you  you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ?\nOh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh\nSo it will have five point five average .\nFive point five average .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nMm .\nWa can  .\nOkay .\nWell , does it\nI sorry .\nOkay . So after , the technological aspect ?\nOkay , techne technological aspect .\nSo we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel .\nYeah , we have the wheel . We also have the rubber material ,\nUh .\nwhich make it uh like new also . I think I would give a five .\nIt's  four .\nFour ?\nA four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation .\nYeah .\nThe rubber is\nOkay .\nUh a four . I I\nD are we including the voice  are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ?\nNo .\nNo . Okay .\nSo\nNo .\nwhat's your uh grade ?\nFour .\nFour ? So we have four , four f and five ?\nWe can put four ?\nYeah .\nYeah , four . Four , yeah , let's put four .\nFor twenty five .\nEveryone is okay or  four poin Four .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nDoesn't it\nVery easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ?\nYeah , I think so . Yeah .\nYeah .\nI give a seven , I think .\nSix .\nI would give a  I would give a seven as well . It's very easy to use .\nSix .\nMm , six for me also .\nSo\n'Kay .\nSix point five .\nsix point five .\nSix six six point five .\nOkay .\nOkay .  Is it fashion ?\nOh yeah ,\nits its f its fruit fruit shape .\nSeven ?\nI would say seven . And is very very nice design .\nYeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit ,\nYeah , we can we can put a seven here .\nand we say that the\nYeah , seven .\nYeah .\nyeah , seven .\nYeah . Seven , okay .\nYeah . Well , we hope .\nEasy to find .\nUh easy to find in a room ?\nI lost my banana .\nI think you can't miss it .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah ?\nUh .\nYeah , I think it's cool . I think we can put a six here .\nWe have the lightning , or\nYeah , we have  the\nThe lighting .\nwe don't sesh especially have the lightning\nSo you'll make the material transparent\nbut\nso that it uh lights up completely , or\nSo it's yellow . It's okay .\nYeah .\nI think it's very easy to\nSeven ?\nI would say seven . It's hard to miss it .\nSix . Yeah , okay .\nYeah .\nIs it  is it robust ?\nYeah , it's rubber , made of rubber ,\nUh f yeah , it's ru it's rubber .\nI think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control .\nYeah .\nYeah the only problem there might be  which  know , i if it's very sensitive ,\nYeah .\nthey will ,\nYeah .\nI don't know\nBut it is uh  it is surrounded by rubber material .\nYeah .\nYeah , okay .\nSo maybe we can put a six .\nYeah .\nMm .\nEverybody is okay , six .\nSix or five . Five\nSix is okay ?\nSix , yeah , for me .\nSix .\nYeah .  Okay .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nS now  um so .\nTadada . We have to sum up everything .\nTwenty .\nThirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six  .\nThirty . Thir\nThat's that's okay ?

We just connect up .\nThank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um  the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional  uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,\nIt's okay  .\nsorry Project Manager  . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .  Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .\nYeah .\nOkay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan .

Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the  Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't  un unfortunately aren't available .\n'Kay .  .\nUm , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment .\n'Kay .\nUm and then we we're loo looking into battery options .\nThere's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we  I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,\nWa  can you explain that ?\npeople won't  it's it's basically like wind-up radio .\nLike a  right , okay .\nSo you wind up your remote control before you use it .\nHow   what kind of  how l long can you get out of that ,\nIt might\nI mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or\nYou  Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get  when when you got T_V_ .\nThat doesn't count though does it ?\nDoes does light charge as as sunlight does ?\nI thought it was U_V_ like\nNo .\nArtificial light ?\nIs it ? Alright i\nAny , any\nHas to be solar .\nYep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or  and dynamo might take more space .\nYeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .\nI'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .\nYeah , okay .\nUh , I don't think it counts electric lights\nMm . Artificial light , no .\nno , but I mean not many  you don't want to limit your market .\nThat's going to\nI mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .\nUh\nI know ,\nBut\ndifferent parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .\nYeah\nRight .\nand most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway .\nNight .\nMm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .\nBut I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .\nOkay .\nThe the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches\nYeah I've seen\nand you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .\nAnd are these like uh  what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?\nUm yeah it's  it charges into um some form of  it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery ,\nMm-hmm .\n'cause they use them quite frequently in watches .\nOkay .\nAnd that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out  .\nWe c\nBut then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time\nYeah .\nso you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd\nYeah and\nI mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah but then again\nIs it really gonna be enough ?\nI I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um  it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .\nOkay .\nAnd th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it\nSo it's not  the draw on it isn't\nand you put it\nHmm .\nno no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be\nMm-hmm . Mm .\nOkay .\nCould I just ask  referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?\nMm .\nI mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging\nYe yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing\nor the two things not compatible ?\nLike a dual kind of .\nbut the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they  because , if you lie   on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .\nMm . So that affects the exterior design .\nSolar would be slightly  expensives .\nExpensive as well . What kind of price are we looking at for\nThey're they're expensive , they don't\nIt's twelve point f\nI presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?\nYeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the  It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping ,\nSolar .\n'cause if you drop stuff  yeah if you if you have y\nWell they're not designed\nthe size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if  remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .\nPractical-wise okay .\nY I think  yeah , practically . I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot  whereas remotes you do ,\nYou do get a bit of wear\nthey can t\nbut don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?\nYeah they do , they  yeah they've got dual things , but they're  the batteries are smaller I think .\nMm .\nMm .\nAnother question is like\nAgain it de\nsorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .\nMm .\nA remote control , like ,\nW m yeah\nso we have to s look at the life also .\nMm .\nso the  Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd  I think the  it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in  or triple A_s would last .\nIt would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature ,\nYeah I think i I think it would , yeah .\ni  it's not gonna add anything , okay .\nOkay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?\nOkay .\nCan we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's\nYeah .\nShouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally\nWell add it in to think about um\nright , okay .\nbecause , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of\nYeah .\nwe're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .\nYeah .\nBut then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than\nYeah .\nthe eternal battle for control of the controls .\nIt's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research ,\nNo .\nit's not a thing that people are looking for\nOkay .\nSo\nwhen we threw it open to the field yeah .\nOkay .\nBut it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .\nOkay , right .\nOkay , well I'll move on .\nMm-hmm .\nUm , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which  pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .\nWhat kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we  what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of\nWell well this  the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have  fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one ,\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nif you if you wanted to but um the  there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit\nOkay .\nso that  And then to  uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was  'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nbut you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .\nOkay .\nUm , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the  there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case  case housing\nMm-hmm .\nand the the main problems with the  well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process ,\nMm .\nwhich to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,\nMm .\nbut I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nI'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite  um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more  they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not  because we'd have it in two separate units\nSecond thing is\nHinged , yeah .\nfor the flip phone .\nyeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever .\nYeah .\nSo in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .\nMm .\nSo is that feature available in like uh titanium ,\nYeah I th\nor it's like only specific to plastic or\nUh . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just\nMm-hmm .\nit w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is\nMm-hmm .\nit's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote .\nIt does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it .\nYeah , yeah .\nI was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,\nRubber , yeah .\nthat would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .\nAnd you can peel them off yeah .\nYeah .\nSo instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,\nLike a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .\nSomething like\nlike those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .\nYeah .\nAlright .\nYeah .\nMm .\nThat could be a good idea .\nHmm .\nMm .\nIt could  it would be comfortable to hold on also .\nOkay . Mm .\nT\nVery cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .\nYeah .\nWell that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .\nMm . Yeah .\nAlso the\n'Kay .\njust just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the  I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .\nMm-hmm .\nNow what I was saying before about instead of having  you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over  if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen  'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they  you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch\nSorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of\ndisplay . Uh what what\nJust what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like\nOh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could  becau you could fit it\nUh-huh .\nthe problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve  curved things with it ,\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nbut um you can  you wouldn't have  with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .\nMm .\nWith  W also with the\nI don't  s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that\nYeah .\nOh it would be flat inside .\nYou could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,\nyeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah .\nMm .\nbut I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside .\nHave I misunderstood you ?\nIt wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut there'd be touch touch buttons ,\n'Kay .\nso you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .\nI think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .\nMm-hmm .\nIs rubber . Mm .\nYeah .\nNow how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean\nYeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .\nUh\nI just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ .  Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to  .\nYeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out\nLike one of the palm pop thing .\nbut I I think they could get a bit easily lost ,\nMm .\nAbsolutely , f for somebody who  very often , if he would\n'cause I had\nYeah .\nIt would have to be attached .\nThey're easy to replace as well , cheap .\nHmm .\na person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a\nYeah . Yeah .\nand he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nMm .\nYeah okay .\nYeah just a thought  they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a\nOkay , we'll talk about that  so if you finish your\nYeah that's\nand we'll come back to that .\nyeah that  that's the end of m my\nThat's you , right okay .\nAnd just one small question before like you are  , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons\nYeah .\nlike we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .\nUh yeah . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple ,\nMm-hmm .\nI mean you'd you'd actually have two separate  you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them ,\nOkay . Okay .\nMm-hmm .\n'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .\nI'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .\nMm .\nIf we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?\nNo .\nAnd they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display  th uh the remote control display thing .\nWe're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .\nUm .\nThey don't look at themselves ? Just a thought .\nWell it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_\nYeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph\nit's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .\nYeah , no , no .\ntrying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much\nMm .\nbut  maybe we'll leave that one on the side .\nYeah .\nOkay .\n'Kay .\nI mean you can  you could do it , you could have a  'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out ,\nMm .\nbut I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about\nOh I think  forget about the mirror\nOkay , okay .\nthat was just a very quick passing thought yeah  .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "components, parts, circuits, things, designs", "dialogue_id": 57}, {"text": "Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .\nMm .\nSo you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .\nYeah .\nAnd uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . No particular remote is standard .\nMm .\nLike , some some people have a   Here you see this ? This is on a  I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .\nOkay .\nOkay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top\nYeah .\nand g graphic user interface\nSorry what does that stand for ?\nWhich means\nbasically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,\nOkay .\nYeah .\nwhich is\nIf you if  yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen .\nLike you have on a l uh  icons or something y you have  is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSo basically  not point or click   Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify .\nOkay .\nAnd on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .\nMm-hmm .\nSo we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .\nCan we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?\n'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .\nYeah .\nNo you'd hold it  you don't  if you flip it open then you'd be  Wouldn't you ? Isn't that the idea ? You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah .\nYeah . That's what I was just saying ,\nYeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li\nBut\nand then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top\nMm-hmm .\nand then be able to touch that for the  other controls ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nOkay and you mean to the\nso have the um the volume and the programme , things like that ,\nAnd the lower distance .\non the lower side .\nOh f perfect .\nOkay .\nHmm .\nSo the findings are too many cluttered buttons . Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . All are confusing and in inconsistent . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the  for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it  this at a low cost , but for  like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it .\nYeah .\nSo it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here .\nYeah .\nSome kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound\nMm .\nand if this can be incorporated this would be more uh  you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also .\nYeah .\nSo we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . My personal preferences would be like , as already  uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh\nMm .\nYeah .\ntomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh\nWell , yeah we\nI think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern\nYeah .\nbecause i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .\nI can't see that , is that play and stop and things ?\nThis is central one , the one you\nOr is that volume and channel ?\nyeah volume and channel . So keep that m  that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here . This and voice recognition .\nOkay . Right . Okay . Um I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . So , we agree on  Do we agree on the battery ?\nThe kinetic .\nKinetic ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having\nMm .\nso we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .\nYeah I think\nIt's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a\nI mean if  Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have\nselling point .\nand also if they've got it  if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them ,\nMm-hmm .\nuh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun .\nI think the only\nMm .\nI think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,\nYeah .\nbut I think pretty much we've used cheap  relatively cheap and simple things .\nYeah .\nMm .\nThe L_C_D_'s not cheap .\nYeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one ,\nHmm .\nI mean they use them in calculators so .\nYeah , okay .\nMaybe we could start with the black and white .\nYeah .\nThat that way we could upgrade later  .\nAnd you could  yeah . Okay .\nYeah , we talked about kinetic charging ,\nMm .\nwe've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?\nMm .\nWell you cou um .\nDo you want like a back-up ?\nNo , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?\nK no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch  a battery that goes in a watch .\nI oh I see . Right , okay , got you .\nSo it's a lot smaller , so it would\nGot you on that okay , didn't realise .\nUm , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo there's not a  really a decision to be made there , um . The buttons  what did you give us as our  The bare-board L_C_D_ or\nYeah the  well I think were  we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons ,\non the on the on on the top one we're gonna\nOn the top one okay you've got the touch\nyeah .\nokay and then\nOn the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones .\nOkay , okay .\nSorry could you repeat that last part ?\nUm , okay on  we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .\nL_C_D_ screen . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nAnd for the  sorry .\nNo , it's fine .\nFor the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah\nPlastic ,\nwe could use the body ,\nFor the inside .\nokay .\nfor the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm ,\nso we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,\nPlast right .\nOh I think so , I think so .\nokay . and it is just uh  although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,\nMm no .\nNo I think I\njust go for the colours .\nIt's\nwe don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway\nOkay .\num the fact  the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know\nThe feel .\nyes . So we could just pick anything .\n'Kay . Mm-hmm . Is that going to be  this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research ,\nUh I  it's different .\nIt's just different\nis that fancy  ?\nit's just different from everything else and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses ,\nMm .\nsort of beige and black\nMm-hmm .\num so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nor you want something that contrasts as  you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and\nMm .\nMm-hmm .  Yeah . I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree . We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things .\nMm .\nThis would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more\nAnd you would just have an  across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little\nWell the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming  I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on ,\nMm .\nRight .\nAnd ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes\nwhich is another beauty of it .\ny you know , you could just go so far with it ,\nYou can you can just\nAcupressure , you could talk of acupressures .\nYeah .\nlike a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever ,\nso I think that's quite a flexible thing .\nYeah .\nAnd finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case  casing  the case outside ,\nYes .\nit should be moulded  it  with  the design in such a way you can change it every time .\nYeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca\nMm .\nnot the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .\nOkay .

Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . Um . It's  probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it . Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Um .\nMm-hmm .\nEighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that .\nMm .\nUm .\nDo you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ?\nI have an a web page yes .\nYes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . Uh about this .\nYep . Yep , sure . Mm-hmm . So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um  and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently .\nMm .\nUm . Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . Um .\nMm .\nAn interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . Um .\nYes yes , I have  that too  .\nThirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps .\nMm .\nUm .\nIt's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's\nThirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . Yep .\nOkay too much time to learn . Okay .\nUm . And thirty  twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .\nNot enough\nI don't know how we'd go about combating that .\n. What do you mean there ?\nFor R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury .\nOkay .\nSo . But\nMm . They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ?\nMm .\nBut it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh ?\nYeah . That's what the report says yeah .\nSo mm .\nUm and then it's got a demographic breakdown on\nMaybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the\nUh I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now .\nYou can disconnect it there\nYou can maybe just just\nno ?\nOh no , yeah .\nAh it's  it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file\nYeah .\nokay .\nUm , s hang on .\nO otherwise you yeah . You can connect this one .\nThen you can connect this one or this one yeah .\nAll to your computer .\nYeah .\nWell .\nSo these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um\nOh yeah .\nOh I need to muck around with this . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . It's just a web link .\nHmm .\nYeah\nOkay .\nYeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design .\nHmm .  Yeah .\nOne thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the  hang on a minute .\nBecause if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important .\nMm-hmm . Yep .\nMm-hmm .\nUm , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control .\nSpeech recognition in\nAnd who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .\nD do you have numbers o o on that ?\nAh okay .\nYes , I'll just get this up .\nSo that we don't  Do we not need any button on the remote control\nWell potentially yeah , um\nit would be all based on speech .\nI think even for interesti\nOkay . Interesting idea .\nyeah I think that would not work so well . You wanna have both options .\nOkay .\nWell it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost ,\nMm-hmm .\nI mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my  well it's  we should be in range ,\nYeah .\nMm .\nor maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . But the these are all quite fancy features\nYeah .\nI'm not sure whether we will we can make this for  for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents  .\nWell it would be f\nYeah .\nYeah .\nNo you can't .\nAnd we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ?\nOh . Well ,  it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three ,\nMm .\nBut it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting .\nMm .\nyeah .\nYeah .\nYes ,\nIt's it's going to be li\nthat that that that's mm .\nit's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case\nDo you have some more important facts\nbut it's  but I don't know with twenty fi\nUm\nor can we go to the next presentation ?\nOkay . So\nWell\nyou had to to to summarise maybe the\nThis is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five .\nMm .\nOkay it's uh decline .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nBut we sh\nMm-hmm . Decline with age , mm .\nYeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um ,\nMm .\nwhich we'll be talking about later I think .\nMm .\nYes . We will talk about it later .\nDid you get the email ?\nOkay .\nYep , that one .\nMm-hmm .\nJust follow that link .\nI thi  You us\nIt'll be in a different window , yep .\nyeah yeah .\nThat's  left  that one .\nYep .\nOkay perfect . .. .\nMm . So that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics .\nOkay .\nAnother thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .\nMm .

You can you can sa take my chair .\nI okay  .\nIt's a channel selection , a module  , this and this function ,\nSorry ? Oh .\ngo to the  . Yeah .\nSo I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer . And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um  is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important .\nMm .\nSo basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit\nMm-hmm .\nand uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright . So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first  the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nSo for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna\nMm-hmm .\nand um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want  . Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh  it's simple but it's it's important , and also uh  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after ,\nMm .\nright . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's  my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control\nMm-hmm .\nright .\nMm-hmm .\nSo of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . This is  very quick uh design , uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd um so what I have found and  after a lot of work actually I  I draw this I draw for you this uh schema\nWell .\nUh-huh .\nthat can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me\nYou drew it a long time ago ?\nyou know .\nIs huh\nNinety one .\nAnd uh that's it so I won't go into details about that\noverwhelming  .\nNo .\nbut uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components .\nAnd and why do you want these kind of component ?\nSo . So\nI mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? What were your\nfound and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive ,\nMm .\nbut uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design , uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components\nYes . It it it's more clear now I think .\nbut maybe yeah\nSo\nBut is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma\nNo no no no we we will uh  This is a preference but we can always change uh\nMm-hmm . What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , I mean can you can you get back to it ?\nYeah .\nYeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . So we we must adapt to the to the receiver .\nOf course yeah .\nI I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh .\nYeah . We will use uh  infrared protocol uh using  yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists\nMm-hmm .\nand but we what we can do is uh uh adapting  the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles .\nMm . Mm . Mm . Mm . Yes . Okay .\nUm . Okay .\nThank you .\nWell it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies .\nThe frequencies ?\nYeah .\nYeah yeah . Of course yeah\nBut you should be careful ,\nin the chip you have it yeah .\npeople are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s  , so basically  through all the things .\nThat can control o other things . Yeah .\nAh .\nMm .\nSo maybe we should think of\nOf course yeah we should take that into account\nThat's handy .\nYeah yes\nSo if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off .\nI I I\nyeah .\nin the uh\nYeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_  and you can just walk away\nYou don't have to be near the T_V_ at all  .\nYeah . I like that idea .\nI I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "presentation, communicating, remote, protocol, controls", "dialogue_id": 58}, {"text": "Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew .\nYeah\nI I I assume you were finished here .\nso  .\nYes .\nUh okay .\nOkay .  So I can take I think mine now there .\nOkay .\nOkay so voila .\nHmm I can take mine it's okay , voila , mm so mm . Okay .\nOh . I  Uh , sorry ? I know where it is .\nIt's on the desktop .\nIt's uh\nTechnical function .\nYes .\nOkay .\nIt's uh\nLike so .\nWell . So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside ,\nMm-hmm . Yep .\nso what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh  um\nMm-hmm .\na and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver . So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later .\nMm-hmm .\nBut in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ .\nMm .\nYep .\nAnd um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but  tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . Then there is uh  this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch  . And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those\nMm-hmm .\nso these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market . And then  whi which is generally used by the people . And then  well personal preferences I would  uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the  we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote  video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with\nOkay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate ,\nso you  on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ ,\nYeah .\nso is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ?\nYeah .\nor does it know which one you want to use ?\nUm actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing\nMm-hmm .\nbut um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option\nMm-hmm .\nand you could play it or  You can also think about having like um   I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box\nMm-hmm .\nand uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you\nMm-hmm . Mm .\nand uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program .\nMm .\nIn that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities  .\nMm .\nMm mm mm mm mm .\nMm .\nThese are kind of next generation  functionalities .\nIt's the next generation thing ,\nMm yes ,\nbut it is going to come in couple of years .\nMm .\nbut I think it's i i it's already there ,\nIt's goi\nI mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop .\nYeah it's\nMm .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . So\nMm 'kay .\nit's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing .\nMm . Yeah . That's fair enough . Mm . But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . That's ,\nNo no we are not making a universal remote ,\nyeah .\nwe are just looking at uh giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box\nMm .\nwhich is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me .\nMm . Because y\nW w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this .\nMm-hmm . Mm .\nMean , you can go  pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects\nMm . Yep .\nyes .\nYeah .

Very well .\nWell . So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently  booming up actually\nMm-hmm .\nMm . Yeah .\nso it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd it\nYeah .\nbasically you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you\nMm .\nYeah .\nand then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ .\nGood .\nAnd thi this is going to come .\nOr even you don't need to download it , it's streamed uh online uh yeah . Yeah .\nYeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie\nMm .\nand\nYeah .\nYeah\nUm , so u um\nso . Yeah .\nI have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you . Um\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nfirst thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions\nMm-hmm .\nbut it's it's getting used less and less .\nYeah .\nThat's that's especially because of the internet of course .\nHmm .\nSo we should think about it um . Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself .\nMm .\nUh as uh a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . Um\nMm .\nUm .\nfurther yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh , or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ?\nSo D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ?\nUh indeed indeed .\nMm .\nAnd and and the hard disk recorders . Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh  y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty ,\nMm-hmm .\nand our our current customers are mainly forty plus\nMm-hmm .\nuh which well\nFourteen\nForty .\nor for O okay .\nSo\nSo\nthat's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older  older\nand you'll al  always need to have the the future with younger people .\nMm-hmm .\nUm therefore ,  younger people like trendy  trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all .\nMm .\nHmm .\nYeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys\nMm .\nyou press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually\nMm-hmm .\nso it it is like uh um i i it is like uh\nMm .\nMa Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh\nMm . But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market ,\nYeah so .\nYeah .\nHmm . Yes yes\nthat's the the the mm the new and the funky things ,\nmo\nBecause they are already used to that , you know , product .\nthat's ,\nYes it's recognisable\nYeah .\nyeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls .\nMm mm .\nThat's\nAnd and they are skilled uh by using it .\nMm .\nSo for example uh  Well uh\nMm-hmm . .. .\nOkay , it works . Fine . So , for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that\nMael can you hand me over this uh ?\nYes .\nUh thank you .\nMm-hmm . Okay . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ?\nMm well\n'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all\nI think fi five min\nForty minutes ?\nand it's a very important issue .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so .  too sorry , so we basically don't change the uh original order of them\nbut then the keys are more spacious ,\nMm-hmm .\nthey don't look uh  so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , uh four , sorry four here uh five and six ,\nMm . Mm .\nso the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice\nMm-hmm .\nfor you don't have too many keys\nMm .\nbut you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to\nOkay .

Which I think is quite tricky .\nUm , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control\nYeah .\nwouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ?\nOf course they have already one . So our our our remote control has to be better .\nBut it's not going to have more functionality ,\nMm-hmm .\n'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might  we'll be able to  beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing .\nMm . I  well I think  many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one\nMm . Yeah . But why are they buying one in the first place ?\nbut  Indeed . So that will be about functionality\nMm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things .\nMm . Mm-hmm . Mm .\nIn that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality .\nSo your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance\nWell , we can't , with the price range . We We're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product .\nWhat do  What do you think about  What componen\nYeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_\nMm .\nand I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps\nMm-hmm .\nand uh we can include it in our control some new new features .\nMm .\nYeah . And um  But yeah\nBut  yeah . If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that\nthat's\nwhich would drive the cost up a lot .\nI don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary .\nYe\nIs the L_C_D_ screen\nFor universal remotes\nI don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary  well , th for long term .\nIf you  mm .\nI think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive .\nAnd quite complicated to use ,\nS so we can try to go in between ,\nyes .\nand offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated\nMm-hmm . Not as flexible maybe , yeah , but s\nYeah .\nyeah .\nbut but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_\nUniversal .\nMm-hmm .\nbecause it has more uh it it is in some kind universal .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nBut if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on .\nMm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group .\nOkay . So they're  yeah .\nPeople  yes . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yep . I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know .\nUh well\nMm .\nI think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money .\nMm . Mm-hmm .\nYeah .\nSo d Do you agree ?\nWell  Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive .\nYeah\nUh and it d uh  Our provin\nbecause we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is  uh price of a chip is very cheap .\nMm .\nMm .\nSo I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less  yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah .\nMm-hmm . You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty ?\nYeah .\nOkay . Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control .\nUh yeah , that's that's what we needed basically .\nMm-hmm .\nMm . Mm . Okay .\nUh that's needed right now . And uh basically you can look to the standards of other\nYeah that's needed , yeah .\nMm . Yeah .\nAnd if we want to get the market , we really need that .\nYeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ .\nActu\nYes . Exactly .\nYeah .\nAnd just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time .\nYes .\nYeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them .\nIs that okay for you ? Yeah .\nMm mm mm mm .\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m  maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content\nYes .\nMm .\nOkay . Okay .\nand uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market .\nMm-hmm yep .\nVoila  . Hmm .\nSo anyone uh has a point to bring in\nSo . Well .\nor shall we  no .\nOh I don't have anything right now . We can we'll we'll go\nOh\nOkay .\nthat's that's fine then .\nand we'll I'm sure we'll up something good\nMm-hmm .\nW yes ,\nfor the\nwe uh we can have lunch now .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo um Then th th the next meeting will uh\nYeah so we meet in  well  what are our\nafter lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting .

Well , take it away .\nOkay uh welcome you all .\nComponents design , um  uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh  elaborate some of the things I did . I I elaborated on the concept . What should be um uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um  you know from what uh the remote control's formed . Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control .  I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about .\nDon't destroy my giraffe .\nGiraffe's gone now .\nOkay um the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . There's one of the  because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control\nDrop it .\nHmm .\nand they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option . But uh it's a very expensive material . Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control . Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to  it lets lets itself colour . Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . But it's a very strong material . Um  I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved .\nUh so it's t two dimensional . I think it's uh it's best to draw oh\nIt's a colour .\ngreen .\nBright colour . Fancy colour . Forward .\nUh  New . Blank . Okay .\nYou have to go t\nLet's make it uh black . Okay . I thought of an idea like this . Oh  that .  Um delete . Blank . Okay . So it also looks nice when it's on your table .\nSo you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands .\nOh it's a side view .\nSide view yes it's side view so uh I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling ,\nbut .\nUm uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too . One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some  or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff .\nAnd um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component .\nTrue .\nSo uh uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh  the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . Questions ,  ?\nNo .\nNo no no no no . Just looking .\nAnd they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it\nwith uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side . Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . That was correct , wasn't it ?\nMm-hmm .\nOkay . I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber .\nWell , business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour ,\nOkay they should be m sh they should be in mind ,\nbut I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .\nwasn't it ? Okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ?\nIt must be recognisable .\nOkay okay . Well that's possible of course .\nYou can put the R_ and R_ .\nWe could make a little R_ and R_  on the top of the machine . Uh so they are  pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they're uh interesting . And uh will buy uh  them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense .\nOkay . Well that's all about my uh my findings .\nAlright .\nOkay , thank you .\nI will go next .\nMm mm mm . Next .\nAlright so\nI thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . And uh  uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name .\nMm .\nThis uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . Um perhaps it's useful ,\nMm .\nMm .\nperhaps for because people um lose the remote ,\nMm .\nthey can yell uh remote where are you and  calls or something .\nIt's true .\nAnd perhaps we could uh implement that .\nAnd then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like\nOh my God .\nbut I can't draw , so uh don't  make too much of it  . I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw  . I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . I don't know if there is an icon for the program , but\nNot just a P_ .\nyeah .\nP_ yeah , just a P_ .\nSo uh\n.. .\nand then the buttons above and uh below\nthe and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . Um .\nWhere's where's the button for two  ?\nI forgot that one .  I thought I forgot something ,\nOkay .\nbut uh  .\nAnd uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth .\nAh .\nDoesn't matter .\nUm an options button . And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options , I think . It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing .\nMm-hmm .\nNo .\nSo could call it settings or something .\nYep .\nBut this is a bit uh how I thought it . And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand or something uh .\nOh okay ,\nBut uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that .\nyeah .\nUh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this .\nOh yeah ,  .\nAnd uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh  And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote ,\nMm-hmm .\nso you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things .\nMm . Okay .\nThat's an option . And that was my uh finding dinge .\nThanks .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nNow our third\nGo Danny , go Danny .\nteam member with his presentation .\nOkay , I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 'Kay . The method I used was  Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's  quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . And the third thing is it should be easy to use . I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff .\nFruity ?\nGrass green .\nFruity .\nYeah . Like that . The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber .\nMm . Okay .\nIt should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things .\nLet's build it into a sponge .\nTh Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . They liked square shapes with round edges . And hard materials like wood , um titanium . They those kind of materials they liked . This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like\nOh y\nthis or something . It's it's a bit like a banana . And the colour should be yellow , or something .\nAnd for the elderly people just plain old . Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ?\nIt was one remote , I think ,\nDifferent colours , yeah .\ndifferent colours .\nWe should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Simple but\neasy to use .\nMm .\nSo that's it .\nSo for the older people , a more traditional uh form .\nOkay .\nThat is my  Yeah , like the older o older colours I can maybe\nYou could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . I don't know which shape you should should take ,\nYeah .\nbut .\nColours th the elderly people\nYeah , I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh\nYeah .\nChanging just the shape of the uh remote control ?\nthe shape of it .\nPerhaps you could find something in the middle . Round but square .\nYeah , s\nround corners , but s but square , yeah .\nBut maybe then both groups won't buy it .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i Do you know what I mean ?\nYeah I know what you mean , kind of like a  .\nwait , like  like this  uh a bit .\nYeah .\nSo it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round .\nKinda like a beer glass .  Yeah .\nSo but then\nI know what you mean .\nSame sides .  But that's uh\nIt's also easy to to have  to to put in your hand .\nYeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's uh  But perhaps that's a good thing ,\nYeah .\nso that's easy to use . People know the\nWill recognise that's as a remote control .\nYeah .\nUh  Look something like that  . Autumn colours like red , brown .\nUh when I saw your d Oh .\nThey liked the wood a lot .\nHuh .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nSo maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour .\nYeah .\nYeah , kinda like old cars , uh\nAnd a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things .\nYeah .\nSwords .\nLet's put it all together .\nThose kind of  Yeah , those kind of things . So you see the big difference between the young people ? Fresh , exciting .\nYeah .\nAnd the old people , old and boring .\nBut that's easily to do with the colour , I think .\nSo  Sorry ?\nThat's easy to do with the colours , I think .\nYeah I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape .\nYeah .\nYeah we think so too .\nUh .\nBecause otherwise we have to  get different shapes , and colour  way easier than yeah the shapes . In material yeah rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones\nand the old people like  plain wood .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that .\nYeah think uh  Also in between .\nSoft rubber .\nYeah  soft rubber\nwhich you can you can feel in it .\nYeah I know what you  Um .\nI don't think you should be able to mould it ,\nOr\nbut\nIt should shouldn't be  .\nNo . Or or wh what's something harder . No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in ,\nYeah .\nor something harder .\nUh .\nBit like this kind of rubber . This uh\nYeah , something like this , yeah .\nBut it's quite hard , this .\nYeah it's quite hard but you can press it in .\nYeah .\nIt's feels kind s spongy .\nSpongy .\nHmm .\nSomething .\nI don't think it's rubber .\nNo . N n n\nSo we need a spongy feeling .\nUh did you have something about uh\nAre you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can\nYeah .\nSo we should first decide about shape , I think .\nDing ding .\nWhich uh\nYeah I think that's the better thing to do .\nThen you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it ,\nand can decide uh .\nUm I also s uh can't help but notice  that you uh used an  you had a remote control\nand the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um .\nYeah\nYeah\nw I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like\nit it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit\n.. . This was your size ,\nYeah .\nbut I think it should be larger .\nYeah three quarter of the of the\nYeah , three quarters . So uh so you don't have to put your   oh .\nYeah the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is\nUh new , blank . So uh when you get  this uh\nOoh\nUh kinda like this .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nOr should it be larger ?\nLarger I think .\nLarger ? Because you want to put your hands\nBut if you pu\nYeah\nNow you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen .\nYou want\nbecau because you have\nPerhaps that's best .\nYeah .\nYeah okay , true , true , true true .\nYour thumb here .\nBut not on the screen because   Yeah\nYeah .\nthat's uh that's an idea .\nYeah .\nLooks a bit like a Game Boy now .\nBecause when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll  you'll always get some\nYou always touch it ,\nYou\nyeah .\nYeah .\nYeah yeah yeah yeah .\nGoing to be very greasy and stuff .\nBut it won't get that small because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .\nYeah .\nOne to zero , the two digit ,\nYeah you don't want it too small . How yeah how large\nYou have to you have to  Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .\nYeah they have thick fingers  . But if you wanna make it in international , Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands\nYeah true ,\nand we got these large\nbut  Yeah , we have we have the zoom option , right ?\nZoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah . You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button .\nYeah .\nYeah . And we won't include a a pen , or something to point ,\nYeah .\nhey , we we want to do it with our fingers ,\nNo .\nright ?\nYour fingers , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nY you could include a pen\nYou don't want uh\nYeah .\nBecause if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use\nUse a pen You you c you can lose the pen .\nYeah but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that\nYeah  the fingers , yeah .\nYeah o yeah  , if they think it's handy to use a pen .\nand\nYeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something .\nAnd maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh .\nYeah .\nYeah  You can do  whatever uh any uh cloth .\nYeah but that that can be  with plain soft tissue . Yeah ,\nOkay well\nyou can buy those at\nmaybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision .\nSure .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentations, presentation, meeting, designing, designs", "dialogue_id": 59}, {"text": "So we can discuss these points .  those points um energy question mark . How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how  are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put  in it . Uh chip on print and case . Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them .\nI think energy were batteries and then uh and uh\nThe docking station .\nYeah .\nYeah . So that's the the the first point .\nMaybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries\nWe already decided that on the previous meeting .\nW\nYeah . Yeah .\nwhich you can recharge through the docking station .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . Just like with the telephone .\nYeah .\nSo if the badg the batteries are dead\nI kinda like your\nthen you can re you can uh change them .\nYeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse .\nYeah yeah yeah like those .\nKinda like those kind of batteries .\nbut it should be th I think normal batteries ,\nYep .\nnot not like two or two uh\nYeah , normal plain you  No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah .\nYeah .\nSimple rechargeable uh batteries .\nYeah .\nYeah . Um what was with the chip on print ?\nThe chip on print ? Um  Uh you gotta f Yeah . I think so . Chip on print with a with a  simple uh a sim not a simple but a\nPrint plate .\nWe also discussed that . Didn't we ?\nYeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? You still have a print plate .\nUh\nYeah yeah yeah . You always have a print plate .\nBeg your pardon ?\nYou always have a print plate ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah sure , of course , yeah .\nright ? Always , so  I dunno what w what we have to decide about that .\nYeah well it's a good question .\nIt just was in there\nWell uh\nand I didn't have any information about it ,\nchip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button .\nbut  Mm-hmm .\nBut when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not   the buttons are not always on the same place ,\nYeah , okay . But\nfor example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same .\nYeah .\nWhen you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the\nYeah okay , but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate ,\nYeah .\nso that that's not of any discussion , I think .\nWell you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess .\nI suppose so .\nMm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's\nIt is a simple C_P_U_ but it doesn't\nYeah yeah okay but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ .\nYeah because it has to uh b\nYeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ .\nYeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume .\nYeah , okay , true true . True .\nSo it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_\nto know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment .\nMm-hmm .  Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen .\nYeah .\nAnd a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen .\nYeah .\nAnd the case , yeah we already discussed the case ,\nIt's rubber .\nwe wanted to make it from rubber\nYeah but but a hard rubber like this ?\nand uh\nOr softer rubber or\nUh hard rubber I think .\nYeah .\nThat's the easy to ha uh to to uh\nYeah .\nIt bounces back from the floor where you  throw it .\nYeah . Yeah sure , look  .\nWe have different colours .\nYeah yeah this in different colours ?\nD\nSo the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? No I don't think , I think it's more round than square .\nYeah it's a bit . But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps .\nSo it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people .\nYeah . But that's what we want ,  .\nYeah . I think so too .\nYeah , that's our target . Yeah .\nIt's our main target .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nLower than forty years , I think\nWell and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ?\nit was .\nSo i\nOh yeah that that  I think  I thought that was a quite good\nYeah .\nBecause it's a gadget and you want to show it off , of course .\nYeah .\nYeah yeah you have a fancy design , then , right away .\nYeah .\nUh .\nSo\nBecause it\nYou can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen ,\nYeah .\nyou don't have to put it  get it in your hand , you can put it next to you\nYeah .\nand then dive it in\nYeah , that's a good idea .\nand  . Yeah .\nIt's a lot easier .\nYeah , alright .\nSo , so\nSo\nOkay so\nyou got uh\nAnd then\nDid you write that down ? Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured  remote control .\nYou can't you You can't oh , you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the\nYeah .\nYeah , you can uh\nYeah but I wrote it down .\nIt's pretty easy but  And\nAnd load it on the the user the server .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "docking, batteries, rechargeable, recharge, mouse", "dialogue_id": 59}, {"text": "What about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that  .\nYeah ,\nYou you showed your drawing .\nI had what I just uh I should  again . I miss a few buttons , but . Well . At least uh   what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh  if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now .\nMm-hmm . Yeah , you have to go back . Yeah uh uh .\nThis\nIsn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?\nI don't know .\nWith the minus and the plus .\nI think it's\nI think it's easier than\nI don't know . I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way ,\nYeah .\nbut I don't know what they think .\nSorry ?\nMm .\nWould you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ?\nFor sound and channel .\nTh\nDepends on the screen . If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . If you make it uh in a rectangle\nRight well if we make it like this , I think if you\nYeah .\nI so it's it's it's it's\nput it like this\nSquare .\nI think it's it's easier to have it something like  Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here .\nOh , okay .\nAnd on here .\nYeah .\nThe other buttons and on here  the top .\nYeah .\nThe options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here ,\nBut I think I wou\nand the sound .\nI think that's a matter of what you're used to .\nSomething uh\nI think I would put a plus and a min uh here . And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle .\nUh .\nSomething like\nSh\nTake your time .\nPlus minus plus uh\nAlmost .\nYeah\nminus .\nbut I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus .\nYeah I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb .\nYeah but I think  Yeah I don't know .  Perhaps I have some examples .\nW\nI don't know\nWe'll leave that to the usability engineering then .\nWho's the usability engineering ?\nThat's me .\nShe is .\nBut I'm going to look if I've got some examples\n'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used .\nOh .\nThe  'Cause they can use that better .\nYeah .\nUm\nConsistency .\nYeah .\nOh   I have that those s numbers .\nI  Here is our  here are uh\nOr a good watch .\nI don't really know .\nB\nEverybody's searching in his data .\nYeah .\nChannel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . Volume selection four times an hour\nYeah but   But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote .\nYeah . So not how much  n not how often it's used , but\nUh\nW what's what's usual or normal .\nYeah , that depends on on on the remote .\nYes I'm looking here . But here's it's below ,\nUh .\nhere also , and now here's here's next to each other .\nI think it's  it's a\nI think  because I have two televisions at home . One is horizontal , one is vertical ,\nYeah .\nYeah it does it doesn't really matter ,\nso it depends .\nbut\nYeah . Depends .\nUh .\nI think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down .\nYeah , lower .\nAnd the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back .\nThat's how it's is usually  when I look here\nTrue .\nthat's what I see .\nOkay , um . Let's cut to the chase .\nIt's got to change .\nYeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons\nI don't know .\njust the\nYeah is it is user interface .\nconcepts .\nYeah .\nComponent .\nThis concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a\nOkay , well le Yeah . Interface , yeah .\nAnd the speech uh shall we implement that ? Or uh\nYeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ?\nTechnologies , uh .\nYeah I think it's it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says I'm here .\nYeah .\nYeah . But then you should also find a place\nMakes it possible to\nYeah .\nYou could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . You can talk into the corner .\nMm .\nYeah , a microphone , yeah .\nNot even necessary ,\nMm-hmm .\nbecause a lotta  you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh  just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote .\nYeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh\nYeah . But  Yeah , that's also  .\nYeah .\nover there .\nRight .\nSo , in the middle or something .\nBut that's not import I think that's not im very important\nYeah , yeah .\nbecause yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is .\nbut you should uh decide where you want to put it .\nAh okay , sure , okay ,\nRight ?\nwell tha\nUm I think where it isn't seen\nUnderneath ?  Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible .\nthe most .\nYou could p you could put it in a logo of the company .\nInside .\nYeah . Well\nYeah sure , why no\nYeah .\nmaybe just in the the spot you just pointed out\nI i between the round of the R_ .\nYeah .\nbecause I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it ,\nYeah .\nbecause it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control .\nYeah . So where do you want to put it ?\nYeah , okay .\nWell maybe where the one hand\nYeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh\nYeah actually it does  because it you can you can find it better if you use it .\nYeah . Yeah\nIt's a way for you to uh\nbu but\nUh .\nSo it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that .\nYeah , okay .\nBut are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ?\nAbout a microphone ,\nYeah because a microphone is very small thing ,\nthere is no button .\nbut you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote .\nYeah .\nI think the left s under corner should be the best .\nWhere isn't  i it isn't most in sight .\nYeah .\nOkay .

Any more uh\nSo well uh\nInterface type .\ntype , supplements , anything . Yeah , well we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_\nThe L_C_D_ yeah ,\nand\nYeah .\nuh supplements well the supplement is to\nI think  I thought the , like you said , like scroll  next to the remote isn't that handy .\nyeah .\nYeah .\nI think it's better to just  up what you'd like to do on the screen .

Yeah\n.\nthe the young people do like uh scroll uh\nUse the scroll . Yeah I think so too .\nYeah ? You do like it ?\nSo why not , on on side .\nOr at least  Yeah I don't know if it's really the scroll , but the menu  they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh\nFast , yeah . So if you've got a settings , if you\nYeah I think it is is faster . Becau I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options ,\nYes .\nbut if you don't have a lot of option then\nBut you have  it's f uh\nYou have a lot of options ,\nwe have five or four or something .\nbecause when you use  Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen .\nY\nMm-hmm .\nUh-huh . Yeah , okay , true .\nYeah .\nSo then it's uh very handy to to scroll down ,\nOkay .\nyou make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use .\nOkay , no problem .\nAnd I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side\nYeah , yeah .\nwhich you can touch\nYeah .\nand\nIt's also different .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay .

Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful .\nUm  now  you can all give your presentations . We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions .  Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . Uh did you all receive that email ?\nYep .\nYeah .\nSo does anyone have any overall\nWell  uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having  no teletext , people are very comfortable  with  the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not  we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now .\nMm . Mm . Yep .\nSo that's , from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack .\nMm .\nAnd so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than\nWell tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet   there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess .\nRight . Yeah . No , I I agree with you .\nOkay .\nSo what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that  identifies our product as better than  because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta .\nOkay .\nSo that's that's that was my reactions .\nYeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television .\nYeah yeah .\nSo we're quite fixed . So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product .\nYep .\nYeah bu but we we're designing only the remote ,\nYeah .\nOkay .\nwe not design the T_V_ .\nHmm .\nSo uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we  people use our remote with .\nYeah . 'Kay .\nHmm .\nThat's right .\nSo it's kind of a stupid decision .\nI think we take with you .\nBut there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext .\nRight .\nFor example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement  wants it as  cheap as possible . Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess .\nThat's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took  they can't ac access their teletext .\nMm .\nOkay . 'Cause we're talking about  eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext .\nK yeah .\nSo so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? What are we bringing in to take the place of this ,\nMm 'kay .\nand we have to d  in my opinion we have to double up .\nIf we lose one we need to bring two or three .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, meetings, presentations, presentation, design", "dialogue_id": 60}, {"text": "Okay .

So I think our kind of  our target here is to  have some kind of very like sleek  nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here .\nMm .\nYou know we don't wanna a big clunker . We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so\nSo you have this ?\nNah . So we have three presentations , and I think we'll go in order of participant number here . So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . That's   Okay .\nYes .\nThat's fine . Okay so\nMm it's enough . But uh click it on off ?\nso you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer . And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , just basically every remote'll need 'em .\nWe need some kinda of power d power source . Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which  and it receives that signal . You need a on-off switch um I don't know how that got in there . And uh we also need to um have the   if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well . Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . So  those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around .\nNow is  would this be  considered just a standard uh um\nI think any des\nThis is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here .\nNo .\nWe're talking about existing technology .\nRight I think\nNothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries .\nYeah this is just  this is just a basic layout of ev  of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that  I mean  that you can kinda say would  would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip .\nOkay . Okay .\nDo we have an idea of costs of different components ?\nUm well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well .\n'Kay .\nUm the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap .\nMm 'kay .\nUm depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h  you know how much power .\nDo we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? No .\nUh I don't have any figures right now .\n'Kay .\nWe uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that .\nYeah .\nUm but  and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think .\nN okay . Mm . Mm the shell ?\nYeah . Basically yeah .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nSo yeah . That's all I have really .\nOkay . Thanks .

Just go up to view .\nClick , don't  Yeah .\nUh .\nMm 'kay\nThis doesn't work .  So yeah function design . Um you guys know me , Pedro , and um what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . Um something cute and small . The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at .\nAnd um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh  that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the  to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their  the stations . There's no need to have that in the remote . So um um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but  um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the\nBut I t I think what the  the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there .\nMm-hmm .\nBecause otherwise we're just going to  I mean  even if it's necessary or not , if you  if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really  if it i  if it isn't more expensive for us to k make  because as far as I understand it ,  it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? So it should be in there .\nRight as far as\nYeah .\ni it's just uh  the cost of an extra button . I mean software-wise there's really no difference .\nYeah . Okay . Isn't\nI think .\nI have maybe a silly question . I  in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the  it's gonna be out-moded teletext . I I don't understand how those two things are connected . How does how does computers and teletext  h how  why is one eliminating the need of the other ? I don't understand that .\nWell maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . So that might play on what we can do .\nYeah the they're basically aiming at saying that  you would use  you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that\nScheduling . Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know .\nand now  Yeah\nOkay .\nand now you can c look it over Internet . But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities .\nI think I ha I agree .\nYeah 'cause , yeah , I just  I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense ,\nYeah , but it's not happen yet . Yeah .\nbut but but but with the  the remote is is used for television , okay .\nWell for me\nWell you have digital T_V_ still already .\nYeah .\nSo so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . S\nUnless you have a\nWell there there is a  for example on digital T_V_ systems you have  you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts ,\nYeah .\nand you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example .\nMm-hmm .\nA a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can  Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext .\nOkay .\nSo now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle .\nOkay .\nYeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . That's the thing . And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and\nI think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . You're not gonna be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . I don't think .\nMm . But still there there's an opportunity . If if it's  , for example , a trainable one then we're  just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it .\nYeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so\nMm . Okay .\nWell I dunno . One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs .\nI think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . Just you know\nYeah .\nYeah I don't I don't see the logic .\nYeah .\nI I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , I just I I\nYeah , and neither do I in fact .\nbut I'm not a tech-mind either . I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and\nBu uh .\n'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay .\nI'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price .\nRight it's just not\nYeah .\nUm but I I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWe are selling it to an existing market .\nI dunno I'm\nYeah but we're not putting some  there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext .\nThat's\nMm 'kay .\nYeah ,\nThat's the problem .\nand and , yeah , and and we're also  marketing a product . It's  what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product .\nMm .\nSo so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing\nYeah .\nbecause all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . So if we drop  if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ?\nHmm . So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 'Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ?\nYeah .\nI don't I don't see it , and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . I need to make it special with a high price tag . I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive .\nMm-hmm .\nI want I want to market it as exclusive . So I would market this product it  at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really  beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility .\nBut i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden  stan standard T_V_ so the place  uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant  high-priced basic remote . Does that make sense , huh ?\nNo I no I I understand what you say ,\nMm .\nbut what I'm what I'm , okay  we probably need to move along ,\nYeah we probably should .\nbut my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product ,\nWe we're doing alright for time .\nand if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ?\nYeah .\nSo that's just my question , but we can keep talking .\nOkay . Sorry that kinda cut into you there .\nNo just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um\nRight . I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people  how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do  to use all these functions . Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna  you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . They want something that looks nice , that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that .\nMm .\nI think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share .\nSo we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . Is that\nI think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits .\nYeah .\nBecause I think as we as we add costs for things like uh  for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think  you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ?\nMm .\nMaybe five percent , you know ,\nYeah mm .\nBut we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this .\nand how much  Right . Yeah okay .\nBe a good idea .\nI'm sorry .\nUh sorry , I didn't mean to cut in  .\nYeah .\nSorry boss  .\nI'm not the boss  . Okay .\nOh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh .\nYou know sell uh  things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh  um voice-activated . I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but\nI think that's probably a question more for for this guy here , yeah .\nIs that for over here ?\nYeah . Well it's kinda both of us .\nOkay , alright .\nIs it ?\nUs us user interface .\nOkay .\nThat's\nMm-hmm .\n'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated I think of of  how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something\nMm-hmm . I was thinking about that . Then your lights would go off , though .\nMm .\nuh and and so so um\nBut this 's just something . I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? What makes this thing attractive ? And it's only for televisions . So we  everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their  their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only . And so to me we have to make this a really special product\nYeah .\nI I I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product . At this price I don't see it yet . I'm  I I go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market .\nHmm .\nBut we th that should be design .\nYeah .\nThat should be the design basically .\nRight .\nI think technology we'd we  we're not in the price range to do it . We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design .\nOkay . Have to do  you have to do it in the box ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nOkay well , so so that's up to you then to  to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary .\nOkay .\nMaybe make it in the form of a gun . We can sell it in United States .\nI have a question uh for you . Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? In terms of making it work or the cost of that or\nI don't   I think all these things are pretty standard . I think we'll be okay .\nOkay . 'Kay . Cheers . Onto participant  four .\nWell  you know for marketing f  marketing for me is uh  and uh how do I go here ? Okay .\nMm you can just click .\nGo go .\nNo no no\nIs that right ?\nyou just get off that . You just click anywhere .\nAh-ha . Yeah , what for me is it um  I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . I just know that I I was identified as a a  we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price .\nMm-hmm .\nThat's what we decided here . Um so what I did is I I decided that  that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself .\nMm-hmm .\nUh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas I was putting together , um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some  I I talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . I don't know . These are just thoughts . Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . So to me it's about selling d uh our identity  our corporate identity along with the product .  Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive .\nMm-hmm .\nUh we're kind of in the middle of the market , but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for  I I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing .

Right ?\nSolar .\nYeah .\nAnd  s for some people  Yeah  .  Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ?\nBut solar\nLike a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . You never have to get  go through the  go through  uh all these different batteries . And also you can  I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design  or for  not just for the user design , but also for the  just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole .

Maybe there's a button on the cradle .\nYep , that's right . I really see\nNow the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ?\nBut the cost i No no . No no , we have t we have to change the end cost .\nWe we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh  Can we dl can we do that without  uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ?\nThere's uh  I mean I don't see it anyway . Yeah , that's gonna be up to these guys .\nWell\nI   my reaction is no , but\nwhat I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs\nMm-hmm .\nand you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers .\nYeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be\nWell , see I I  see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls .\nI  I\nEvery home's got to have it . If you don't have one , hey what kind of remote do you have ? Oh you've got one of those , oh fantastic , I want one of those too .\nYeah .\nI just don't have enough money right now .\nI just don't know about that , because in order to do that   in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um\nNah , I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext .\nBut I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have .\nYep , one one thing I don't understand is h they've they've given us this package , okay .\nMm-hmm .\nNow uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . They say they say okay here you go . They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nand and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . I don't know what kind of role we have in this  in the corporate ladder uh , but to me it's like , okay , you have got your  here's our ideas , okay .\nMm .\nAnd then let them look at those ideas and they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no , but  to me it's it's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? beca I I do not  I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now .\nMm .\nI don I I d\nI don't see it .\nI have to disagree though . I think our market niche is basically people who need   who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . It does what they need . These aren't  I I think that it\nAnd and th to get to back to another point , sorry uh uh  for cutting in but , I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah , 'cause it's selling on its own .\nRight .\nIt's not going to be specifically for Hitachi T_V_s or or whatever .\nRight .\nRight .\nNo I understand that .\nSo technologically , if I understand it , uh T_V_s  T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes . All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code .\nSo saying that it works with all T_V_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with D_V_D_s and other things .\nMm-hmm .\nNope , they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions .\nOh okay okay .\nYeah y y you you wouldn't\nThey've identified this product limita\nWe have done this .\nThat's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this .\nThe interface will be different .\nI see .\nIf we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext .\nRight .\nAnd it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable ,\nWell here's\nAnd I I'd\nbecause who wants just a television remote ?\nMm sorry .\nRight . We he well here's my thing about that .\nI don't .\nIf you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . If it can't control  if it can't control your your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just  you can throw all your other remotes away . I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote .\nThat's right .  I I I have a tendency to agree with you . I really do .\nSo we really can't chase that .\nThat's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . I really question where we create the demand .\nSo I think what we\nWe're really looking for something basic .\nSo that's what I'm saying\nThe the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . We're selling more than just the product . We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . We want people to eventually say , oh that's that's Real Reaction that's a good m make . It's reliable . And and we're gonna make it  we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product\nor for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced ,  and solid . So if we can make  if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely  big thing .\nMm-hmm . I think that's big .\nW  okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make  go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da .\nGood design .\nWe only have a few minutes left .\nBut what I'm saying is right now we're middle market .\nIs twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ?\nOkay .\nYeah\nI think so , yeah .\nfor for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro ,\nOkay .\nand that's for the multi-functions , uh D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , uh catch-alls . And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . So to me  , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I don't know what that is . It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features .\nWell I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it ,\nYeah .\nbut we're really doing that to sell the brand . Yep we have five minutes left . Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions .\nOr my d\nAnd I can communicate this to to the more senior  uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction .\nWhat about um the idea that I had with the cradle ? How do you feel about that ?\nWell how does everybody feel ?\nOr how does everybody feel ?\nI mean I I  well we g we're talking about the other end now .\nI I think\nI like it .\nNo , but I  that's the thing I I don't think it's necessarily the other end .\nI like the idea , but we have t we have to find out\nThe other the o the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer , would I wanna buy that ? And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs , I'll take it to different\nMm-hmm .\nI w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . It  i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair ,\nRight .\nand that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . So it's very good for some people but it's not a like\nWell it lasts  it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle .\nBut it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent .\nYeah\nYou have to l sort of remember .\nwell it  Mm-hmm .\nYou have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nWell .\nI d I d I d I think it it  in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact .\nMm .\nBut I I don't know , that's just my opinion .\nWell , I think again it's it  we have a cost issue here . You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range .\nMm .\nAre we gonna make this  selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ?  Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet .\n'Kay .\nI don't see it yet .\nSo what do we think maybe we should  Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ?\nUh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good .\nW  a question I have in in a   'cause I I I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing .\nReally need to wrap up now .\nCan can can we have multiple designs ? Have a modern , have a traditional , have a  you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . I don't know what that creates cost , or\nWell the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . So\nYep one over another . Yeah , okay , I hear that .\nYeah , complicated but\nUm but what we could do is some kind of  well I mean   Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel   it has to feel good in your hand ,\nYeah .\nit has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . Even though the cost may be low .\nYeah .\nWhat ab what ab  what about a a remote that's  that  doesn't maybe look like a remote ? Just an idea .\nMm-hmm .\nJust just okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . They're selling these things everywhere . Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone .\nOr what if it looks like a pen ?\nDoesn't matter , yeah .\nYeah .\nI'm just jus I talking about some  something to make this thing unique .\nA pointer ?\nIt  That's the thing , I'm gonna keep thumping on .\nYeah .\nI'll sell whatever you guys design .\nMm .\nYeah .\nI don't have a problem selling a product , that's not the issue . I give you ideas , you guys create the product . Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . Don't worry about it . I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings .\nSo\nOkay .\njust  to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . Um I really   un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle .\nYeah .\nOkay . Yeah .\nBecause I really think i in a certain sense it almost like  for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . Maybe th th th that's just some people that like that .\nI mean there's al there's also remote controls I remember that that worked uh , this hasn't been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch .\nA lot of people\nNo no .\nAs a watch ?\nYeah , there is remote control watches um ,\nMm 'kay .\nbut I think they're a sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it  uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now .\nYeah they are not simple .\nThose things may have been inexpensive for all I know .\nMm-hmm .\nOne thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken\nThat's what I was saying .\nWe gotta stop ?\nGotta cut up .\nWho's lost or broken their their remote . So  how many remotes do they wanna buy ? Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ?\nExactly .\nMm .\nYeah .\nAnd so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ?\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nHow does this happen ?\nThe last remote you'll ever buy .\nAnd also presumably they've\nAnd and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy .\nWell if if we're going down that then we can  we don't need to go the\nExactly .\nit it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make .\nYeah .\nWhereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones\nTrue .\nyou can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there .\nRight . Yeah . The locator'll definitely be more expensive . Mm-hmm .\nUm need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products uh checking quickly our Internet . We really need to finish up here . But uh\nuh  we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot .\nYeah we have the  the power-adaptor products . We sell power-adaptor products . So for example there's nothing stopping us using that technology .\nIt's uh just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting .\nYeah .\nSo we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about .\nYeah I think so ,\nA charging system .\nwithout it being too  In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here .\nRight .\nIf if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics .\nRight .\nOkay .\nI think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery .\nYep .\nYou know , something like that .\n'Kay . Thanks guys .\nYep .\nNo that's not what I want , I want  Oh look it here .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "remotes, remote, solar, batteries, battery", "dialogue_id": 60}, {"text": "Hello again .\nHello .\nHi .\nHey , Project Manager .\nUm , Project Manager , I have something to tell you .\nMm yeah .\nI have a little problems with my laptop .\nOkay .\nAnd uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete .\nOkay .\nNo , a little problem , uh  big problem . I just thought\nWhat was it , problem ?\nUm , it didn't work anymore .\nThe laptop ?\nThe entire Windows uh\nIt hang  hung .\nIt it hung .\nHa-ha . Oh . Project Manager .\nYes .  Yes .\nYou're our Project Manager .\nYour project manager .\nWelcome to the conceptual design meeting\nfor Real Reaction .\nUh , hello again . Uh it's uh the same as the last time . Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations .\nAnd we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh  visited .   information .\nDuring lunch , yeah .\nMaster .\nHe's the master , yeah .\nThe the the the the concepts on uh  we uh  where we uh must reach a decision on . Um uh , our  from uh are of two sorts .\nMaster of\nComponents concepts and user interface concepts . Uh , the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh  Well , we have decided to do a  do the uh  with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable . Uh how how about the energy ? Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? Uh , the user interface concept . Uh , with the type and uh the the supplements . So uh where to put what button .  And uh uh I would say uh  Jans , can you begin ?\nYeah , sure .\nOkay .\nAt the end , uh  I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder .\nOkay . Uh , let me see . I think it's this one . Ha .\nWow .\nRight . Uh , well , I'll be talking about the components .\nUh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups .\nMm-hmm .\nUh below forty five and above . And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and  how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . Well uh what I found was that a senior um\nsenior citizens uh\nI'm sorry .\nYe Ah , it's  it's okay .\nOkay . Go on .\nUh   They , well , they like more the  they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more .\nWood and chrome .\nAnd uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . Um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials . Think of the Teletubbies , for instance .\nUh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and\nWell uh , shapes are curved and round .\nY y you get  the picture . And uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . Uh , so w well uh , firs\nOne one little question .\nYes .\nUm about the the material .\nYeah .\nUh a soft material for a remote control ?\nNo , I'll I'll get to that .\nOkay . Yeah .\nYou you'll see . Yeah .\nThank you .\nUh , well f first off , let's start start with the energy . W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources .\nMm-hmm .\nBut uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy . I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . That would be actually very nice , uh I figured .\nOh .\nWell , we could also use a battery , that's a bit\nYeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ?\nYeah . Yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit .\nUh , and uh uh\nAnd then then it d then it has some more uh energy .\nHmm .\nWell , y you could just go for a battery . Or you can go for both ?\nOh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?\nYeah , I actually did . But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . Well , sunlight preferably .\nW  nah .\nUh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something .\nMm . Yeah .\nUh for uh ultimate b uh  n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh  you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface .\nMm yeah . It's too less space .\nYeah .\nSo uh  so i i it it wo what's actually  I I c just in f I've figured it out that well , uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_ , and the  from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light . So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_ .\nYeah .\nBut , well you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used .\nOkay .\nBut you prefer kinetic ?\nSo  I I prefer kinetic because it's uh  well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery .\nOkay . Yeah , but you don't move a a remote control too much .\nI mean , if  No , but uh d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you\nAnd that's enough to to keep the energy level uh\nYeah , well uh actually it is .\nOkay .\nAnd it it  if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again .\nYeah .\nBut , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery .\nOkay .\nAnd when the battery doesn't work , I usually shake it too . So\nThank you , Tim .\nExactly .\nLike slamming on it .  It's exactly the same .\nAnd so that  Uh   Uh well ,\nf furthermore , you you  we   uh checked uh the cases .\nWe have uh different options uh concerning the cases . You ha I  you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh  it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring . So you you  we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . Um , single curve , it's just a  well , uh , you know , it's just uh a nice curve . Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's  like several different dimensions .\nYeah .\nThat gives you an whole new uh effec\nDynamic dynamic look ?\nHmm .\nYeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . But , that uh we'll discuss later .\nBut , are you going to draw it ?\nWhat ?\nTh th yeah . Yeah .\nYou want me to draw in three-D_ ?\nThe  Yeah . Yeah .\nUh , I c I can't imagine .\nUh , yeah , I ca I ca I could I could show you . I could show you .\nI can't imagine how how how it looks like .\nWell uh let's say y uh you uh\nYeah .\nLet's say that's your standard uh\nDesign .\nYeah .\nThat's a bit your d standard design . But you could actually go like uh something like this .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd then uh in three-D_ effect you could go\nUm\nUh\nSo y you you just  Yeah , this is a  this  bit uh difficulty in\nI didn't take a major in art . So   But but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth , you could you could uh just play around a bit with .\nOh , okay . Okay .\nYou you don't have to use standard uh\nOh , okay .\nA little artistic .\nYeah you could  y It leaves more space for creativity .\nOkay .\nUh that might be an idea ,\nOkay .\nbut  just a  Well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? You  We could choose uh what uh what's better , plastic um or rubber . I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh  Yeah .\nIt's soft .\nYeah , it's soft and it's  that   I like soft .\nThat's the material the younger people want uh , ain't it ?\nYeah , yeah I mean uh plastic uh is  Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it ,  like plastic uh  Your your  I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap . Uh that's maybe just me , but  Uh , we could uh uh , oh , talk about it later . Uh furthermore , buttons . Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . And uh chip set , well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set . But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen , we would use an uh  we have to use an a advanced chip set . And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it . So that's something we th have to keep in mind . If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise , we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons .\nWell , I think uh we're going to sell tell  ten millions of them . So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan , like uh Samsung , can give us uh a big discount on the chips , so\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah , probably .\nU usually , chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar .\nYeah , probably , but  But uh yeah , that's that's\nSo   That that shouldn't be a real issue , I think .\nThat shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue . I'll I'll I'll just add , uh uh I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . Uh  what i what are your ideas  concerning battery versus kinetic ?\nUm , I think you should use kinetic as a back-up .\nYeah , you you you should  we should\nYeah , a combination .\nA combination , yeah .\nA combination . Uh ,  you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . When you pick it up , it charges up .\nYeah . Like an uh aku uh\nYeah .\nAcu uh , yeah .\nYeah yeah , I know .\nOkay . Yeah .\nJust like the watch from Seiko .\nWell ,  . Yeah .\nPsycho-kinetic .  Yeah .\nYeah , I con Exactly .\nYeah .\nWhat uh what do you think ?\nI I uh I would prefer uh both uh too .\nYou agree ?\nYeah . Combine them .\nYeah ? Both ?\nCombine them .\nOkay . Uh , well that would bring the m m some more costs , but I mean the\nOkay .\nWho cares , right .\nThat's the Project Manager's problem .\nBuy a fifty cents battery and uh\nOf course . Fifty cent .\nYeah ,  well   Fifty cent uh\nUh , why doesn't  And then we have single-curved versus double-curved .\nWell maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that .\nThat   Okay . No , we'll we'll just wait and uh  Uh , plastic versus rubber . Any ideas ?\nRubber .\nRubber . Yeah .\nUh , rubber ?\nUm , isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is  or bendable remotes where you've got a  .\nYou\nOr do you think it\nUh , I figured it will be m rather than hard\nRubber casing , yeah .\nNah , rubber c uh this is a casing , yeah . Rubber casing ,\nRather hard .\nbecause well if you use an uh d a touch-screen , uh it's just a casing uh around it . So um , you could go for plastic , but I figured\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm , well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have .\nI I I would choose rubber .\nUh , is it possible uh of  is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? It isn't , I think , yeah ?\nWell , m I don't know . No .\nWell , I think that touch-screens are generally square .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nBut it's the case you put around it that makes the shape .\nWe're  We put fashion in electronics ,\nThat isn't\nso maybe we can uh\nHmm ? Yeah okay , but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen .\nMm yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , that would cover it .\nThat\nThat that would solve the problem .\nOh , yeah . Okay , I I get it .\nThat's  it's custom customisable and\nMm yeah .\nSo mm  Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ? I I I prefer rubber .\nYeah , me too .\nMe too .\nOkay .\nYeah ?\nYeah , you too ?\nThat's good .\nYou sure ? You  you you seemed to hesitate a bit .\nWell , as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm , and you don't uh  it's not bendable or something ,\nMm yeah .\nI th I think that goes too far .\nYeah , it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh\nOkay .\nOh .\nNo , that that that that's gonna  The the chip set will hold it firm in place ,\nOkay .\nand uh and and uh and a L_C_D_ screen also\nIt might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .\nYeah it  m might it might .\nOkay .\nUh , tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_ , well I figured we we all set on that .\nAnd uh , then also the simple versus advanced . Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we we should have the advanced .\nMm yeah .\nSo that shouldn't be a problem .\nYeah .\nOkay , well that's my uh\nThank you .\nUh , you're welcome .\nCan I uh do my thing ?\nYeah . Do your thing , Tim .\nIt uh\nDo your thing .\nBring it on .\nExpert map .\nOkay uh  Last week\nI went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching .\nFor marketing . Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan . In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um  what they like in design uh and material nowadays . Findings . Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following . At first , the colours of fruit .\nVery basic colours , like Janus explained . Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow .\nUm , considering material , um   Yeah . They like spongy material ,\nSpongeball .\nlike  yeah a sponge-ball .\nLike a s soft material .\nYeah .\nJanus m uh mentioned it also . I think he did some uh some findings himself .\nWell , the Teletubbies sh\nYou wer you weren't in Paris ?  Okay . Like this . Like big uh g flashy colours . Fresh .\nFlashy . Yeah .\nIt's nice , I think . Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . Uh   Yeah , uh materials like wood that\nYeah , but wood is not a not a material you  which you build a a remote control of .\nWell , you could . You you could .\nNo n j just j just a w\nYeah but  never seen one .\nIt'll float .\nNo , okay , but just just a wooden uh look .\nCase . Oh , a wooden look , yeah .\nYeah .\nLike uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor .\nTables .\nOkay .\nThe  that isn't wood anyway , but  Okay ?  But , that's our secondary audience .\nYeah .\nSo , uh we decided to take mm yeah the people below forty .\nYeah .\nSo , that  this doesn't apply . 'Kay , the third . Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . They have to look fancy . Um , they should be technological in innovative . That means uh there have to be fancy things in . Uh , and easy to use . But that's common . My personal preferences . We have to aim at a mu at the  main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours .\nWould you prefer uh uh  that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or\nUh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point .\nOkay .\nHere , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control .\nOkay .\nLike the Nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one .\nYeah . Okay .\nUh , a third , material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber . Um , two advantages . Uh , it fits within the current market trends . And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it . So  Uh to come back to your question , I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . Like uh seen on regular mobile phones . Actually , they have a lot in common . The phones and the\nWell , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so  Yeah .\nAh .\nYeah . Yeah . Okay .\nMaybe you could use your remote as a phone .\nHey .\nHey .\nThere are numbers on it , so uh\nThat might be a next step .\nYeah , exactly .\nUh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function  uh recognition .\nUh , it's very innovative . Innovative .\nSo that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh\nYeah , like something .\nOkay .\nYou you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak  uh speech recognition and stuff . But , we have to keep the cost in uh in mind , but it\nTwelve fifty uh\nYeah , it it can be uh very expensive .\n'Kay , second .\nUh , building games like Snake or Tetris  to amuse the younger users .\nUh , also the link with uh mobile phones . Uh\nYeah , but you don't use that   th games when you watching television , I think .\nWell , yeah .\nNo , but  No , okay . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . It's just the same .\nWhen your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .\nYeah .\nYeah , okay .\nWhen you're at college .\nYou take your remote control with you .\nTake it .\nYou take your uh remote with you to school .\nUh   No . You al  you also take  uh t\nYeah .\nyou take your IPac and go uh play games . Yeah .  Yeah .  Well , I do that , but   Okay , and um\nAnd third , I stick with it ,  the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .\nOoh . S\nVery nice .\nThat's it .\nUh great  .\nMm-hmm .\nIn  Okay . Um the interface contents . Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen . Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . Maybe even li like this with uh  u uses of a lot of space . And uh make the menu structure changeable . So if you press um system , that's\nYeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . Or maybe even a step further when you want to um t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . And um well , how do  uh do we want to look at uh uh f um  Yeah  Does a remote look  Well , it's  you've gotta hold it in one hand . So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . And some remotes you can use with your thumb . But I think that's too difficult for this one . So you can make it s a little broader . Yeah . And here ? And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons . And use your other hands on the menu structure . So here are gonna be the program buttons . One , two  , three , four , et cetera . And the the volume control and program control maybe . And , down here , um , I added , this could be one uh big L_C_D_ . Um , the menu structure . So you can use it in uh in this way . Um   One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time .\nUm ,  know that if you are changing the menu structure here , um  And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . Just keep it as simple as uh as possible . And do not use too many levels . Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and um push plus twenty times .\nBut just the um uh just in one button if possible . And um , well , you kn you all know the T_V_ levels . Um , channel one , two . And when you get to n to uh to ten , ye and want to go back , uh well you have a problem . Just m most most modern T_V_s , you   you press one zero , and it goes to ten . And else , to one and through after that . So the s a button less . And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu . Things like um um  Yeah .\nYeah . Uh , what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button ?\nYeah , yeah w Yeah , I I find I must trying to uh tell it .\nL like in uh internet explorer .\nIs uh volume plus and minus ? And this is program uh plus and minus . Uh\nYeah okay , but does it  that is for uh going from four to five .\nYes .\nBut if you go from two to eight , and you want\nOr if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two\nYeah , and on two . That you can switch switch easy .\nWell yes , I think that's a good idea . But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .\nYeah it is . Yeah .\nAnd if you're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . You just don't have to play games uh in-between . But if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time uh to d use the other options .\nMm no .\nUm , yeah already already told that .\nThat's it .\nYeah . That's my conclusion .\nOh , okay .\nOkay .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentations, presentation, programming, conceptual, meeting", "dialogue_id": 61}, {"text": "Uh  I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with . The parental control , the games , and the voice recognition .\nUh\nThere's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh  I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . I don't know how you think about it .\nYeah .\nWell , I agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere .\nYeah .\nUm , yeah um system properties , um parental control .\nYeah but  What I see uh   How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children .\nYeah . Mm .\nYeah .\nSomething like that .\nUm , w well , yeah .\nAnd w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to\nIt it has to be fast . You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .\nYeah , ok\nNo but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television , and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that .\nMm-hmm . Why  Mm-hmm . You c may use  like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three .\nUh\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . Pu push parents .\nAnd if you push parents , then\nThat  then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in .\nYeah . To log in . Yeah . And if you puts a ye\nLike two one three .\nYeah .\nUh-huh .\nAnd it's in .\nAnd if you w you push p children , uh you don't have to uh log in , but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh\nIt automatically goes  Yeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nOkay . Well\nI don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such . And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it .\nMm-hmm .\nWell I think that's a b there's a big market for it ,\nI don't know what\nbecause uh you  Yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah , they believe that children uh are influenced by the television ,\nMm yeah . V violent T_V_ .\nand uh  Well , we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years . But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh\nYeah . Well , maybe um some idea on that .\nYeah .\nJust make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles ,\nYeah .\n'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the  uh things to do .\nYeah , of course .\nYeah .\nJust make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something .\nYeah yeah .\nYeah .\nThat's a that's a better idea ?\nYeah , w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain .\nYeah . Yeah , okay .\nBut if you want to install it personally uh  If I got kids , and I could choose between uh two remote controls . One uh w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with .\nYeah , with and one without . Yeah .\nUm , b well , still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones .\nI th Yeah .\nYou're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see , but well ,  I I  when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come\nand uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed  instead of uh of channels ,\nYeah .\nbecause if you're watching uh , I don't know , you're in the  at day uh , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night .  I don't know .\nYeah , maybe it can work with show view . Uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view .\nUh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out .\nYeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they  remotes and edit it all ,\nYeah . That's true . Yeah .\nwill have to decide uh\nYeah but yeah but that isn't possible .\nThat isn't possible .\nYeah .\nBut , well , if you want to  I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up  for instance .\nYeah .\nWell uh , nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel .\nHmm .\nWell , yeah you could say if parental control is only  it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but\nBut that  Well , I'm not sure because um for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant uh constant signalling .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWhat m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . And that uh provides parental control , for instance . And that's just an optional uh device . So there's n that's  there's   uh besides uh the remote control , you'll have a separate uh\nI wouldn't put it in an optional device . That that then then then it becomes too much , I think .\nYeah ?\nIf we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .\nYeah , and\nYeah , on a separate menu uh option .\nAnd and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open uh the thing and and and g\nYeah .\nYeah , that's true . That's true ,\ngo to a channel .\nbut uh at same instant , same happens when uh you have remote control . So\nYeah , yeah of course . But\nBut , only difference is uh  the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control ,\nand those people wouldn't uh necessary want it .\nYeah . Ah it's\nSo , you  you'd be\nYeah . Yeah , okay . But it's just an an added feature feature .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? I personally think that that becomes too much .\nYeah , well yeah , I\nIt's more like it gets you to the functionality , but\nA mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition .\nYeah .\nBut I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming  one , and you f the channel switches , uh  Yeah .\nMm yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But\nOkay .\nYeah .\nAnd games ?\ngames . It doesn't\nYeah . I can see games happening . Yeah .\nW you can put it on chip anyway , so uh\nYeah .\nThat would\nAs long as it's  isn't a primary feature of the remote ,\nThat that doesn't c that doesn't co\nbut uh\nYeah , that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think .\nOkay . So that will uh  that that that must be in it , you think ?\nYeah , that will be nice .\nOkay . So the games uh are in it . The voice recognition are not . And the parental control are\nOptional in\noptional ?\nYeah , it's it's in it . But too ma I I think so , but\nBut how we do it ?\nYeah .\nWell , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . So we should make it too complex .\nOkay .\nIs t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on .\nYeah .\nBut uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem .\nYeah , okay . Uh , but uh will there uh uh  Like the first idea uh from uh  You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh\nMm-hmm . Well  Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and  make it an menu option .\nTo put\nYou can put on\nYeah , to put it in always .\nYeah ?\nYeah . And you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something .\nMm yeah .\nWell , I don't know . I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . But it would would be uh more expensive . So , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . Could ma make the uh  simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance .\nOh , it's a p Yeah .\nYeah , but T_V_s aren't capable of sending .\nYes they are . Yeah .\nYeah ? I thought they were just\nYeah , you yo\nYeah , you you have some T_V_s  any\na able to receive . Yeah , some . But\nYeah , but most often not .\nYeah . That is true , that is true .\nWell , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock .\nYeah .\nAnd there's just some little uh clock in the remote .\nWell yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily  to the mote control .\nYeah , j just some rules .\nYeah .\nBut you still have the problem about uh the television itself .\nNo , no , it's very simple . There uh th I h I've seen some of  remotes who have a clock in it .\nYeah , yeah yeah .\nSo , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock .\nYeah , okay . But , on the T_V_\nYeah ?\nat least my T_V_ , is a is a compartment which you can press .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd there are buttons uh behind it which you can use , if you d if you don't if you don't have a\nYeah .\nYeah . Well , that's  To put it very blunt , that's not our problem . Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh  It's not not a part of the remote .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah , of course .\nYeah , that is true . Yeah , that is true .\nYou have to f Yeah .\nYeah , you could you could you could go like\nUh , or make it ourselves very diffic\nuh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy .\nYeah .\nYou could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , I figured  I figure we could do that . Yeah , yeah , sure .\nOkay .\nUh , I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but\nOr j Yeah .\nAh\nI have to uh  consult my legal advisor about it .\nOkay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that  Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic .\nThe case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that  with cover is removable .\nThe buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons . And in the the menu structure , uh there must not to be uh  Five minutes to go . Uh , too uh too many levels . And uh it must be easy to use . The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . And the games  are in it . So\nI think we have uh we have decided uh , okay .\nOkay .\nConsensus .\nUh , little more .\nOh . Oh . I I have one thing left .\nOh .\nYeah .\nMaybe for uh Jerome .\nYeah ? I'm listening .\nUm , the views . Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .\nLike a like a moat or s or something . Yeah .\nYeah .\nUm , well\nUser profile .\nLike at  In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons .\nYeah , but you have that in the\nWhat I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple .\nYeah . You use the\nAnd when you push uh system properties , uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program .\nYeah .\nYeah . It's already incorporated a little in that concept .\nMm yeah , okay . Fairly enough . Yeah .\nWell yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .\nYeah , wh which buttons you like or not .\nYeah , which buttons do you want to in it . Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .\nYeah . Yeah . Just leave the other numbers away .\nOkay .\nYeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that .\nWe take it to the other meeting , okay ? I have a little w uh little chat to do\nOkay .

Import export .\nAnd uh another one .\nSom some bench-marker .\nUh , they're a ha they're at  Yeah , benchmarking , that's the word I saw .\nI uh couldn't uh  Okay , uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey , and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us . So , we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company , uh a trustful company , and uh it has m\nHow  I know a marketing name for our product .\nOkay .\nR_ th R_ to the third power .\nR_ three .

Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design .\nCould you plug me in ?\nOkay . Thanks .\nAll ready to go ? Okay .\nOkay .\nUm so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the  The first one  is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the  of the remote control .\n'Kay .\nUm they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ .\nOkay .\nAnd the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .\nAnd the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?\nWell that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um  uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say  Uh something\n'Bout putting the fashion in electronics .\nMm yeah .\nYeah , I mean do they   Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . So that's something we can discuss as well . So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . Um so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ?\nNope , we're all set .\nRight um , time for presentations then . Who would like to go first ?\nI'll go first .\nOkay , cool .\nSure .\nAlright um , can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? Uh\nOh yeah , of course , yeah . G go on ahead .\nso this is the technical functions design . Um   Right  to do the um  the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products .\nMm-hmm .\nUm I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um  your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so\nOkay .\nRight .\nUm , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing .  Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , um  sh show you now . Uh\nAlright  .\nhere um the button there and there . This one's prog . Sorry . That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . Um it's a very simple one . It's got only the basic functions mm but um  it's the same size as the the hard to use one .\nOop .\nUh it looked a bit clunky . They're very big and not very much use for  buttons .  Um ,  and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . Um it's very easy to use . Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls .  Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha  from the bottom of it . So ,  now I'd like to ask for your preferences . Um not sure of how long we've got , uh\nUm . Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most .\nMm-hmm .\nJust a couple of minutes anyway .\nM yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research .\nMm-hmm .\nBut anyway ,\nShall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now .\num we might come to that later .\nWhich which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. .\nUm , the clunky one is the one on the right .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nUm clunky in what sense , like um h heavier ? Larger ?\nUm I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . It's , you know , it's very spread out\nI see , so it's more just basic .\nLooks kind of  Yeah .\nand kind of  you know\nRight , okay .\n, I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size .   got very few buttons on it and\nYeah .\nYeah . Sure .\nWell I think it's a valid point . I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , so maybe you know\nMm-hmm .\nyou know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open ,\nI think that's a good idea .\nMm-hmm .\nI think it's a good idea .\nMm-hmm .\nUm ,  do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ?\nMm-hmm .\nI mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down .\nMm-hmm . Uh-huh .\nUm they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ .\nUh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah .\nOkay . Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? Would you like\nWhich was that ?\num the channels like the the numbers on thing , um\nUp  the numbers , or the up down ?\nGod , I wou I would say that's required ,\nI mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels ,\nYeah .\nI mean would anybody disagree with that ?\nYeah .\nUm , what else , uh   So don't need to worry about teletext ,\ndon't need to worry about V_C_R_ , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about ,\nWe don't ? No ?\nyou know like brightness and contrast ?\nYeah . Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ?\nMm .\nIs that right ?\nYeah .\nIs that what we're we're doing ?\nUm , yeah .\nWe're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ?\nUm\nI think  are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ?\nUh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have\nMm-hmm .\num and after that we can add things if they're possible .\nOkay , right . Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this .\nYeah .\nUm , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and\nYep .\nThere's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .\nRight okay . Um\nWell , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go .\nMm-hmm yeah .\nUh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .\nOka\nFor example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um ,\nMm-hmm .\nthings like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available\nand then others that are concealed .\nOkay .\nSomething like that .\nUh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section  Have I just lost  Oh no . Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . Any of  you anything to add to that at all ?\nYeah .\nNo .\nNo .\nI'll add it later , I guess  the presentation .\nOkay , right .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nUm okay ,", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "teletext, remote, meeting, chat, channel", "dialogue_id": 62}, {"text": "if we can move on to next presentation then please . Um\nSure .\nDo you wanna\nDo you want to switch places ?\nCan this can this pl reach ? Can this plug come across ?\nNo . No .\nProbably not , actually .\nNo .\nSo why don't I just pick up and move then .\nYeah .\nHere , I'll just  Why don't I just\nJust just switch them .\nMm er , can you go up behind me ? Kinda  This is so  This\nbit complicated . It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ?\nI'm all in a knot now .\nOkay .\nRight .\nUm . So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh  the things .\nOh , like overlap between what you said ?\nYeah , yeah .\nOh well , for all you know that  that'll happen .\nWhich is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely .\nMm hard to know what  where your role ends , yeah .\nObviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been\nOkay .\nSo how do I how do I get this up ?\nUm function F_ eight .\nUh pr yeah , press function and F_ eight , yeah .\nOkay . Okay . Alright . So  F_ eight ?\nFunction , the blue button . Next to the control on the left . Yeah .\nOh , and F_ eight . Okay .\nYou have to push it together .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nYep .\nOkay , I think that that's doing it now .\nNope . Try that again .\nUh , again ?\nWait .\nThink maybe the the wire in the back might be loose .\nOkay .\nYeah , you wanna  Oh oh here we go .\nUm ,\nYep , there we go .\nThere you go .\nokay great . Okay . Just um  Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's  now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so .\nIncrease that 'cause we can't see the\nUm\nOkay .\nOkay .\nThat's much better .\nRight . Can you um\nThere you go .\nRight , okay .\nOkay . Alright . That would be  Okay . So um does that make sense ? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could  and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . Uh to think about trends and also about  try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um\nBouncing on top .\nDunno . Okay . Um .\nYeah .\nSo this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . So they find them ugly . Most people find them ugly . Um  the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay I'm gonna  we'll look at that in a second . Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't  doesn't really appeal to them .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like  if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . Um ,  frustrations . They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . Um , takes time to learn how to use them . This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . Um and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for .\nRepetitive strain injury .\nIs installing a new remote control something that people\nUh , no , that did not come up at all . Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . Um .  And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be  wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy .\nMm-hmm .\nUm people  uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like .\nOkay .\nYou know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .\nSo want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah , so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through .\nMm . So it  you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know .\nYeah .\nThat's  I think it's a good idea .\nYeah . That's s that's sort of the um  But I  I'm  my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it .\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nUm I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that .\nMm-hmm .\nBut not let that confine us technologically .\nOkay . Right .\nSo Alright ? Any um comments on all of that ?\nWell , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um  who's our our target audience , our target market .\nThat's uh\nUm , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ?\nYeah . Okay .\nI mean\nWhere's the money , maybe .\nYeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine ,\nYeah . And who watches T_V_ . Mm-hmm .\nwell I don't  I'm not really sure how much that will retail at .\nMm .\nBut you want  it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one .\nMm-hmm .\nSo , who do you think we're aiming this at ?\nYeah .\nUm , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?\nIt's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think .\nIs that too  is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ?\nYeah ,\nMm-hmm .\nRight .\nokay .\nUm so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . Kind of .\nOkay .\nYou know how much ? I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ?\nOkay .\nLike a simple replacement , right . I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get ,\nYeah . Yeah ,\nYeah .\nyeah .\nwould you  how much would you pay ?\nThis this kinda touches on your comments there , David . These are the age groups which we have information on\nYeah .\nand these are  this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature .\nOkay\nJust gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is .\nOkay .\nMostly focused around the twenty five age group .\nYeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ?\nYep .\nSort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm\nYeah , okay .\nUm\nUm do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? What what do you think , Craig ?\nWell , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? Sort of the the older group .\nUh , yeah , it's the  Yep .\nUh f\nIt does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying ,\nN yeah .\nin terms of\nI think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want\nOkay .\nand 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it .\nYeah . Sure . Sure .\nSo um anybody  anything there to add\nYeah .\nJust kind of young professionals , uh th like  if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . So we could say that was our target .\nMm-hmm .\nI I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well\nYeah .\nbecause that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology .\nMm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nMm-hmm . Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young .\nYeah .\nYou know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing .\nYeah .\nI think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nwho are familiar with their  with computers in in their everyday work .\nYeah .\nI think people who are maybe about  I wouldn't say thirty five ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nbut people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But  yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , sure .\nSo these are people who are gadgety , right ?\nSo\nMm-hmm .\nPeople who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities ,\nYeah .\nwhen you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular\nYeah . So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech .\nYeah . Yeah . Mm .\nThat that's that's a good point .\nYeah .\nUm okay , so um\nso shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition\nIf we can .\nI I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now ,\nif we can .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nbecause um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple .\nOkay . Why is that ?\nYou want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .\nRight .\nOkay .\nCould it be an on off thing ?\nUm ,\nLike if you want it on\nbut what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology ,\nWhere you can activate it and deactivate it ?\nYeah .\nrather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah . Sure .\nSo maybe we should\nSure .\nOkay .\nI suggest that we think about speech recognition ,\nYeah . Sure .\nanyway it's a  it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first .\nUh-huh .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSure . Yep .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "presentation, switch, slide, wireless, relay", "dialogue_id": 62}, {"text": "Uh okay , well do you wanna um give us your presentation\nOkay , sure .\nand then then we can  I don't know\nYep .\num might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're\nYeah , it's good  well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind .\nYeah , exactly , yeah .\nUm\nOh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well .\nNot\nUm .\nYeah . And not losing . And also it helps in terms of people not losing this ,\nYeah .\nyou know they  they're saying oh it's  I lose it in the couch .\nYeah .\nlike we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together\nMm-hmm .\nthat they\nI reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours .\nReally ?\nChannel up .\nRight .\nOh really , you've seen one before .\nDo you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ?\nUm   I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .\nSorry , do you mind passing me my notepad .\nMm . Course not .\nThanks . Cool ,\nThere you go .\num . Okay . Um .\nRight .\nWell this is just the working design um .\nMm-hmm .\nWell this is just what  how I would go about it . Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is .\nRight .\nWe've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're  we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like  Besides the basics , I think back  in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ?\nMm-hmm .\nUm and I just  the idea is just to get everybody to um  I usually  have a have have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that  to start everything going . But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think um there's a need for that . Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first . It just explains how the process goes through , from a\nMm-hmm .\nfrom the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . Um okay , you need some power source . 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies\nUh-huh .\num how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want .\nMm-hmm .\nLike for example , voice recognition , right . That might be constrained because that  you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . Um  Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever .\nHmm .\nYou know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic  a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . It's fairly general , um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike um voice recognition , right , um , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . So it's not really a constraint in that sense ,\nOkay .\nbut I mean these are functionally , you know , the base ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nwhat the technology has to do .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nUm so I guess the rest of it\nMm-hmm .\nI think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? I think that's more relevant to a discussion ?\nUh .\n'Kay .\nWell , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ?\nSure . Sure .\nYeah , w I'm done .\nAre you are you all done ?\nMore or less . Yeah . Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing .\nYep .\nMm .\nUm you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip ,\nOkay .\nyou know , stuff like that .\nOkay .\nRight .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "speech, presentations, presentation, talk, microphone", "dialogue_id": 62}, {"text": "Um\nRight .\nAnd like on the  means  b\nI guess this would be\nSince we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like  what are our options ?\nYep .\nAlright , what's what i in  Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin\nUm , these these aren't technology options in that sense . This is just um\nRight .\na basic principles and basic components that are needed .\nThe basic principle of\nOkay .\n'Kay .\nFor example , if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split ,\nMm-hmm .\nRight .\nbroken down into more components , right ,\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nwhich you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that .\nOh . So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing .\nOkay .\nUh Yep . Yep . So each component represents one function ,\nOkay .\nbut I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nand the power are things that you won't have to care about .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it .\nYeah . Mm-hmm .\nUm there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example .\nOkay .\nOkay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ?\nOkay .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nBecause that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right .\nOkay .\nRight .\nWell well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it\nYep .\num because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha\nThere might be one other problem with the transmission , um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them .\nMm-hmm\nI it\nOh , yeah .\nyou may not require that ,\nRight .\nbut you know , um it's it's\nRight .\nit's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user ,\nYeah , mm-hmm .\nand push a button maybe to start s talking about it .\nOkay .\nThen you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it .\nMm . Mm . Yeah .\nSo in that sense , there's not really a restriction\nOkay .\nbut it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process .\nRight .\nNot so much further down .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nAnd um just a clarification before we finish this . Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ?\nThere's there's not much specific specific information ,\nW\nbut I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . Because infra-red is something which everybody has .\nYeah . W Well well we've um\nOkay .\nIn the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ ,\nJust to T_V_ , okay .\nso that's what we should do for now I think . Something I was wondering about was the power .\nOkay .\nUm , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think ,\nThere's a there's\nor should we just consider running on regular batteries ?\nOkay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it ,\nUh-huh . Uh-huh .\num and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nOr you need to get the user to plug it in .\nOkay .\nOkay ,\nUm and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller .\nso  Yeah .\nBut unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month ,\nYeah .\nthen I don't think rechargeable is something we should  you know , we really need to care about .\nOkay , so just stick to to regular\nYeah .\nUm .\nOkay . Um , right . So basically the um  I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at ,\nand what exactly the product's gonna do .\nOkay .\nSo um just to recap on\nOkay .\nAre we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do .\nYeah , that's good .\nDo you wanna recap on that , Craig ?\nUm .\nI think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel .\nOkay , right .\nTa .\nAnd is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ?\nUm I think we include mute , but apart from that um I think we just  we'll go for the simpleness .\nOkay , I think\nOkay .\nOkay . R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under  like sort of under a door or some\nYeah , it's as optional functions .\nYeah .\n'Cause what what I'm  I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that .\nOkay .\nI dunno if that'd be a problem .\nAnother thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories .\nMm-hmm .\nOne would be audio controls ,\nYeah . Okay .\nMm-hmm .\none would be video controls , and the other one would be a device .\nOkay .\nUm this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device ,\nYeah .\nbut I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear ,\nMm-hmm .\num it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into ,\nYeah .\nRight .\nlike if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .\nYeah .\nI mean it might help with the visualisation .\n'Kay , okay . Like that . Okay .\nAnd it would actually help with the component build as well .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay , right .\nMm okay , great .\nUm , okay well I gotta kind of  got five minutes to wrap up now . Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . Whoohoo . Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next  well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\num for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . So um I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking .\nUm , do you wanna start with David . Anything else to say at all ?\nMm no , not really .\nNo , okay .  Andrew ?\nUm yeah , just  I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this .\nYeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea .\nMm .\nUh-huh .\nShall we do that , then ?\nYeah .\nOkay , great .\nUm just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ?\nUm things like on off . Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value ,\nYeah .\nyou know , um so um\nOkay .\nUm\nAnd and channel .\nAnd channel . Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound .\nRight .\nYeah .\nNot on off video . Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound ,\nOkay .\nsay you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device .\nOkay .\nDevice is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . We put it out .\nOkay , so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume  hi\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , anything to do with what you hear , right . You you put that into audio .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd then video is anything that you can see .\nOkay , and then visual\nMm-hmm .\nOkay , so brightness , contrast , things like that ,\nMm-hmm .\nUm . Yep .\nand then just actual device things ,\nColour , yeah .\nYep .\nlike what channel you're watching , turning on an off ,\nSure . Sure .\nYep .\nstuff like that .\nOkay .\nOkay , um\nAnd then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more\nLike random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . Sure , okay . Okay .\nYeah .\nUm even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind .\nOkay .\nIt's easy to use , I think that's one thing that um  and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well\nOkay .\n'cause things are like fixed .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nUm so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good ,\nbecause of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at . Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nyou know , things like that . Um ,  so I guess I guess that's it . That's the meeting over .\nGreat .\nWhoohoo .\nThen we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "functionality, microphone, audio, basic, technologies", "dialogue_id": 62}, {"text": "That should hopefully do the trick , um . 'Kay . Sorry about the small delay . Falling a little bit behind schedule . And that's uh fifteen twenty five . Okay . So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? Uh The new black , I believe .\n.\nUm something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , of course . Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . Okay . So um due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype .\nOkay , it's a\nQuite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure ,\nI think if we both step up\nbut\nand uh outline our ideas . Okay . Now do  uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh\nOkay .\nju just a thought . You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . But as you as you see with the uh  with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain  ergonomic design . Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down .\nI'm afraid yeah .\nYeah .\nWe'll go into that a bit more ,\nthis design could be done with um with uh plastic casing .\nbut please go on .\nThough I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . So .\nAny further comments ?\nUm obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , won't it ?\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\n'Cause it  you can't get it curved .\nYeah , I mean the\nUh because of costs .\nuh  Yeah .\nAnd it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand .\nYeah . I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand .\nMm .\nOne nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have  the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh  of the rigid substructure . So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely .\nMm . Lovely . Um .\nYeah ,  .\nOkay , yeah . Great . Um .\nRight . Yeah I've got a  if you load up my evaluation document .\nYeah , okay  .\nOkay .\nExcellent work .\nMm .\nUm .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "prototype, l_c_d_, design, display, l_e_d_", "dialogue_id": 63}, {"text": "Uh evaluation .  Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by .  Um then we will  it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . So um not seven steps , seven scale . So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . And uh the criteria  based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . 'Kay . Um if you flip the   So , those are the criteria . And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means  that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points .\nPut it mildly . So we have um true ? One , t Seven , eight , oh . Fourth . Okay , so we have to go through each point . If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a a score . So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . I mean , uh is the homing thing still  the locator , is that still\nYeah , that's still part of the design .\nSure . And Adam , we can keep that in ?\nYeah , I believe so . So I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost ,\nOkay .\n'cause that would mean doing something about the human element ,\nSure .\nbut I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have .\nT\nMm . Mm . And making it a bright colour helps\nSure .\nwith the  personally I would have gone for purple  .\nMm . Bright colour . So we still have that noise thing , yeah ?\nMm-hmm .\nOs on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding  finding it once it's lost ?\nI'd say number one .\nNumber one ?\nOne . Yeah .\nOkay . Number number one for the first criteria .\nI think w if it was just the sounder then th  I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is .\nYeah you can tell what room the mobile is\nBu\nWhat about  what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume  can't find remote . Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . Mm .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um\nYeah .\nLike y you wouldn't hear the speaker  .\nMm-hmm .\njust before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is\nYou wanna say something ?\num if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright .\nThat's fine .\nYeah , is that\nOh that's that's fine .\nUm so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this .\nWhat do you mean cr is there anything I wanna\nI is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ?\nUm , a few .  Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . So they say we put the fashion in electronics , well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion ,\nOkay .\nso . That's this bit right here . And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it's kinda condensed into one . And we can come back to it , you said .\nOkay .\nSo .\nNo and which we will do very very shortly . Um . Okay . Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface ,  require more buttons , etcetera . Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . So we're just managing it really . Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um .\nDifferent languages ?\nThat should still be viable . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility .\nYeah .\nUm but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here .  We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . Um . We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um . I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person .\nMm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h  is have it um circular and have it s  so that the uh the pink  actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . Mm .\nOkay .\nMm .\nSo that uh th\nIt very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . Um .\nMm .\nDo you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ?\nUm b b b da is  you mean on the plastic , or ?\n.\nLet's have a look . You now have as much information as I do .  Um .\nYeah , yeah .\nSo as you can see here , for example , the battery really not very little choice in that one . We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick .\nWhy would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? That's quite significantly expensive .\nI  that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . Um\n.\nMm .  yeah .\nas you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price .\nYeah .\nSo um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design .\nWe don't even have uh speakers here . The  like uh we uh  what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ?\nMm .\nUh no , we haven't , not\nTransmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ .\nIs that gonna be a button , or\nThat'll  it literally would just be a button .\nYeah .\nWe might have to\nThat's too expensive  isn't it ?\nIt looks like almost nothing  Mm . Oh good call , I missed that .\nI I mean it's not on here , but um .\nthat's a very valid point .\nDid they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ ?\nYeah .\nOkay . Well that's  yeah .\nSo if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display , then that's\nWhat's a hand dyna dynamo ? You have to wind it up ?\nI believe so , yeah .\nThat would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such ,\nTechnology . Yeah .\nFashion .\nyeah .\nOkay .\nSo basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now .\nBeing manipulated by the joystick , yeah .\nOh , and joystick , yeah .\nWhich I'm defining as scroll wheel . Um .\nAnd we couldn't replace the joystick , right ? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive than a  but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ?\nMm .\nYeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation .\nSo  The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of\nIf we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves\nthe remote .\na fair amount . Which you could\nBut that's what makes it uh original though ,\nMm . I think  if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings\nYeah .\nisn't it ?\nand we just  we could just put our branding on any other remote control .\nYeah . Yeah . Um . Uh k\nIt's a shame . We should possibly have  If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to .\nDoes this does this bear in mind that  I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components ,\nAgain , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one .\nyou know .\nUm but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm  we're gonna have to stick with these figures .\nMm . 'Kay .\nSo , I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us ,  despite the cost it's gonna incur . Um\nI think so .\nare people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ?\nMm-hmm . Um yeah  I mean one thing , I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean  keep the um the articulation ?\nIt's hard to tell . Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved ,\nThis is what I'm wondering .\nand even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation .\nOh\nYeah .\nno , I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved .\nIt can be s yeah , it can still be single curved ,\nIt's uh it's just  it's just  it's just that the case would come in t  would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation .\nbut\nSingle curved with articulation ?\nYou just  .\nCould we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 'Cause like we  do we have re restrictions on software ?\nThat's what we need for the joystick I think though .\nMm . Yeah , I mean\nOh but there has to be\nand  I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . Um I mean  yeah ,\nBut the curves all o over  hand ,\non the  on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it\nis it ?\ncould just as easily be done um without curves . The curve that's really needed is up here ,\njoystick .\nto put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand .\nOkay . Sure . Okay , my bad .\nWe wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation .\nMm .\nUm unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal .\nSo I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria .\nWhich is what we can get onto now . As long as  so are we gonna say   w we have to keep an eye on the time as well , but we're gonna say um single curved design\nOh , wait a minute . Sample speaker ? What is a sample speaker ? Is that somewhat similar to what we want ?\nIt could well be ,\nMm no\nbut at a cost of\nthat's that voice response thing that we got the email about .\nCosts four .\nYeah .\nBut I thought it was just completely pointless .\nYou got a email about voice response ?\nYeah .\nI did not ,\nAlright .\nso .\nB i basically it was  saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice  .\nOkay , yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one .\nWe won't go with that one , did you say ?\nYeah , that's voice recognition , so .\nI mean I  we  Okay , okay .\nUm . So , okay yeah , battery definitely ,\nSo it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca  locator thing .\nIt looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , um .\nYeah .\nOkay .  Okay .\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe even slight well oh yeah , pretty much point two Euros , I'd say . So we'll leave that one for now .  we'll just have\nAre we going for a special colour at all ?\nIt's uh a case of um I'm uh slightly unsure . One  point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . Um .\nMm .\nWell\nAt which point if\nI was  for a case . Or had you already incorporated that ?\nOh , special colour for the case .\nWell you got point five there . It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . I'm not quite sure if they're  I don't think they mean point five Euros per button .\nOkay , well\nMm-hmm .\nl let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case\nSo\nand then we at least have  make it a little harder to lose .\nThere we go .\nBecause most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room .\nW what's the default colour ? White or black ?\nBlack's probably the normal colour you'd say ,\nOr grey .\nyeah .\nRight .\nI quite like that colour that you're fetching there ,\nYellow .\nit's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better .\nYeah .\nSo will we go with that then ?\nOkay .\nIt's not and we can see\nYeah .\nwe'll come back to uh your evaluation\nSure .\nwhich you're probably now going to pan us but there we go .\nOkay . Okay .\nSo uh\nJust to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time . We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet ,\nRight okay .

Oh that's it's very ambitious ,\nIs that being too generous ?\nMm . I'd  I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion .  Is the sole criterion for being um fashion  fashionable or inspired by current fashions .\nyeah , um .\nOh dear ,  .\nSure . Inspired by  .\nUm I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually .\nWell this this what we're gonna t this is their motto , like .\nYeah .\nAnd we're we're not doing well on it .\nThis is their strategy . I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . Might  we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one .\nWhat would you think yourself ?\nI would say  I mean it's it's not at all , right ?  In any way or shape or form .\nWell , it's kind of curved\nWe didn't m\nand we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like .\nOkay , the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay .\nSi it's got a curve to it .\nRight five . Is that  sound reasonable ?\nAm I  do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ?\nYeah , I'll go with five .\nFive .  Yeah . 'Kay , so we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . Which gives us an average of three . It's  well this would be in the middle .

I'm I'm sorry .\nY oh and you've knocked batteries out .\nUm right okay it's\n'S bad design , that thing .\nconsidering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive  you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nit was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly , based on um the the cost features .\nMm .\nMm , yeah .\nEven if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , we would have to do  I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things , so I think we're definitely on the good bit .\nEven if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . You know , it's  yeah ,\nMm . Personally , I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control\nwe did it w it was okay . It was good .\nthat you've already got , are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ?\nWell , it depends who your  who's  what the target people are , like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious\nMaybe it's been targeted\nwomen would be going , oh look at that , 's cool , it looks like a\nMm-hmm .\nit's yellow , looks like a banana , it's cool it's gotta  look good in the sitting room .\nHide it in the fruit basket .\nRather than the L_C_D_ whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology  it's good , it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick . So , which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ?\nProbably the people technologically . They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff .\nI think so .\nI mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she's had it for a long time , you know . She uses it to make phone calls and that's it .\n.\nYeah . So I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , you know .\nMm-hmm .\nShe'd be like is this a remote control , I don't  how do you use it , and stuff like that . So even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time .\nMm-hmm . I s  I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative , um for someone who's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting .\nYeah . Yeah .\nUm .\nI think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons ,\nYeah .\nyeah .\nYeah .\nBut like radical good , maybe .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "buttons, remotes, joystick, controls, remote", "dialogue_id": 63}, {"text": "Okay .

So\nJust maybe it's easier if you um  Yeah I think you will tell  your presentation as well . Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about .\n'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that . Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So  Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . So\nMm .\nsome things . Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . Then these are the  This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . Um  Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . Um they like to use new f new functions . But they also are very critical . They won't spend their money very easily . So  Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . Um  The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . And the functionality  As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily . Um  Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .\nOkay .\nThat would be all .\nThank you . So anybody have um any questions until now ?\nAny questions ?\nAbout functional requirements ?\nMm-hmm .\nOkay\nNo .\nthat's clear .

So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh  Yeah . Uh uh uh  Yeah . In one um remote control .\nOne remote .\nBut um  Yeah .\nUm yeah . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control .\nUm few uh buttons but uh  This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um  Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . So uh like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um  My personal uh preferences um . Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . So um  Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um  Uh this the remote control uh\nand uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh  I dunno um  And um here you've got a s kind of a display . It's a touchscreen . So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh  . And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or   So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device .\nHmm .\nSo uh that's uh my uh idea about it .\n'Kay .\nUm yeah and  Uh let's see . Uh yeah . So a touchscreen . Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . Everybody uh have to use it so  Uh ol even even old people um young people . So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . So uh  Um\nYeah .\nYeah . Uh yeah . That was uh my uh part of it .\nOkay .\nSo\nAnybody has questions about the technical functions ?\nWell\nI think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros .\nYeah .\nN I I don't think so .

Okay .\nYeah .\nI think it's going to  Uh it's not too much . Okay .\nOkay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . That's it .\nOkay . Thank you .

Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements .\nUm that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because  uh it will be too complex\nOkay .\nand the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . So it has to be simple .\nMm .\nUh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control .\nUm internet is also mentioned  in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert .\nBecause he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . Yeah .\nSo is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?\nUh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um\nMm .\nYeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . And new T_V_s will have internet access on them .\nBut I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim .\nYeah .\nIn addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . I'm pretty much against it .\nAgainst the no teletext ?\nMm .\nYes .\nUm\nBesides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small .

Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market .\nYeah .\nAnd um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .\nYes but it's not the biggest part of the market .\nNo .\nAnd besides that , they're not very critical so  I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .\nBut don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think   the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it .\nSo let's try it .\nNo .

It's a big success .\nYeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think .\nVery big success .\nI haven't heard of it .\nYeah . Uh .

So I suggest uh\nI think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .\nIt's\nYeah .\nMm .\nIs anybody um really against teletext ?\nNo .\nNo ? Just that , that we just keep the teletext . I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles ,\nYeah yeah .\nand they push the button and they get the big subtitles .\nYeah . Yeah .\nUh that's a good idea .\nUm so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um  Functionality should be few buttons , you said .\nYes .\nI think uh that's very important we have a few buttons .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo to keep it simple .\nBut I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause  Well might be .\nIf it's only for televi\nBut I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway .\nYeah . Yeah .\nNo .\nYou need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel ,\nYeah .\nvolume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but\nYeah . But do you need\nSo we can s we can skip the display ,\nI think if you if you only l\nso uh we don't need it .\nBut do you need the buttons for one to zero .\nNah .\nMaybe c we can\nUh\nThink if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that .\nMaybe we can use uh\nYeah .\n'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .\nYeah .\nNo , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? Or a joystick like ?\nMm .\nThere are other ways too . Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or\nYeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nThat's true but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many T_V_s have that .\nYeah .\nMm .\nAnd besides that it's um  If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons .\nThat's right .\nSo perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nthe numbers yeah . Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . But I think there won't be very much buttons .\nYeah .\nOr there don't have to be a lot .\nBut I don't think  I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . I don't think there's much to be gained in that area .\nThe number of buttons ?\nHmm .\nI think it's very important in the in the design .\nYeah .\nYou can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with\nThat is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ .\nTo operate only the T_V_ yeah .\n'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either .\nNo .\nNo .\nSo .\nSo I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .\n'Kay . So we can\nThat would that would cost a a big marketing expedition\nYeah . That's right .\nwhich was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot .\nYeah . So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .\nUh uh like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons .\nMaybe . Well yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and  But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .\nMm . No . Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ?\nIt should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy .\n'Cause it can be\nNo .\nNo .\nAnd if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible\nYeah .\nyeah .\nNo .\nBecause I think that's uh  That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station\nYes .\nor very\nHmm .\nThat's a nice requirement . Docking station .\nSo we're just gonna focus on the extras ?\nI think so .\nYeah .\nMm .\nYeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a\nYeah .\nlike to have extra in a new remote control .\nThat's a good point . Um  You said they easily get lost as well .\nYes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .\nYeah . So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .\nYeah that was what I suggested .\nYeah .\nLike with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound .\nYou have it on\nYeah .\nYeah\nHm .\nyou have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station .\nYeah .\nAnd you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .\nYeah . So\nSo you know where it is .\naudio signal should be possible as well . I think it's not too expensive .\nNo .\nUh another point is the L_C_D_ screen . Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because\nY i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause\nYeah . It will be too much as well .\nMm .\nit's uh\nI think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does .\nYeah .\nAnd it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,\nBased .\nOkay . Yeah .\nbut\nJust the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen .\nJust a small screen\nThat's a good idea . So\nwith two\nSome extra info . Feedback .\nYeah .\nYeah . I think that's a good idea as well .\nYeah .\nBut I dunno if that would\nAs the small screen .\nthat would fit into the costs .\nExtra button info . I think that should be possible as well . Um  let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions  Yeah . 'Kay . And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one .\nSo that doesn't really matter .\nMm .\nNo .\nSo I think we nee\nI think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters .\nUh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe .\nMm . Yeah .\nYeah .\nUh what do we want ? If we want um a  with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can\nI think\ntarget the real elderly people .\nI think that would be a  If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company .\nYeah .\nAnd I think , I think there would be a good market for it .\nSo that's the\nIf we're able to really bring an innovative product .\nNow you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .\nYeah the really\nYeah .\nMm .\nSixty .\nBut I'd have to look into that a little more .\nOkay . And different cultures . Are we\nWell I don't think they have different television sets uh\nOkay .\nMm .\nin uh every country .\nNo .\nNo .\n'Cause\nWe've got five minutes left  just now .\nSo 'Kay .\nSmall warning .\n'Kay . And with uh the little screen in it ,  which explains the buttons . You could  I think we n it would be a lot easier to\nShould\nadapt it to different cultures .\nYeah . In different languages , you know . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nor you have to put a language button in it ,\nRight .\nbut that will be a bit unnecessary I think .\nNo . Yeah .\nYeah .\nIt's better to put it on different markets with it all .\nYeah .\nOkay . So\nYeah .\nthat's the the target .

Okay . Okay .  So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay .\nLooks strange .\nYeah .  Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour ,\nOkay .\nuh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .\nOkay .\nIt's  we call it a mushroom design .\nIt's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .\nYeah . Uh\nSo this is a introduction of our product .\nGenetically modified mushroom I will say , but\nNext a mo\nYeah .\nOkay ,\nkeep on speaking .\nyeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .\nOh .\nYeah , yeah I'm sure  .\nMaybe , I hope so .\nYeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design .\nYeah , that's true .\nUm , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel .\nChan\nSo it's quite convenient for user to use it .\nYeah , okay , but don't touch  don't destroy your prototype .\nYeah , s\nokay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so\nEverything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom .\nYeah  .\nYeah , everything's mushroom . Mush Mushroom design , yeah .\nYeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh  like lemon shape , you know , centre  is yellow and t d\nYeah\nOkay .\nYeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it .\nTo integrate , you know  yeah .\nI don't think   I hope nobody will eat it  You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the  the  in\nOh .\nYeah\nYeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits  yeah .  Yeah .\nFruits and vegetables .\nReally ? But  Fruit and vegetable ,\nVegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable .\nso mushroom was a kind of you know  uh\nYeah .\nI don't think it is .\nIt's vegetable .\nMushroom ?\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nOh , uh I'm not sure .\nSo th it's something eatable .\nWe can  it's a veg a kind of vegetable ,\nYeah .\nbut you know we we integrated them with different colour .\nYeah .\nBut anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine .\nYeah .\nI think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable  you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know .\nNo , I mean , yeah  yeah .

Okay .\nOops .\nOuch . So\nOkay .\nDo we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?\nYeah , I think so .\nI think you have nice colours .  I don't\nBut is it\nThe sha the bowl shape people like .\nYeah , the shape is unique , and the colour\nUh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really\nIs it really fancy ?\nSo it depend on how d do you define fancy .\nYeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look .\nBut it's  you have the lemon aspect of this th this  this thing .\nYeah .\nMaybe if you change  if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that\nDo Don't do that , please .\nI dunno where the lemon is , but\nI it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so\nI mean it's not obvious .\nIt would be bet more like a lemon ?\nYeah .\nIf\nBecause i\nI dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or\nYeah .\nLess button .\nUh so , my mush  .\nLooks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ?\nYeah , but you don't have any button now .\nMm .\nYeah . I dunno .\nAnd you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ?\nYeah .\nThat's uh yeah , is that\nHmm .\nthat's a good idea .\nYeah , it's getting\nIt looks  more like a pineapple .\nSo that's great .\nSorry .\nThat's great .\nWhat's the use for that ?\nI have no idea , so .\nUh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .\nI have no idea  what\nAnd where is the voice recognition ?\nOkay .\nUh . Ah , it's embedded , your microphone .\nOkay .\nTh this th th there's two two functions .\nYeah , that's  Wait th that's the second point .\nThis is microphone array\nFirst one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .\nIf it is fancy or not .\nOkay . Is it better like that ?\nI mean\nLooks  okay ,\nSo we can we can say t\nlet's say it's a pineapple now .\nThe colour , is the colour acceptable ?\nNo , the colour is okay , that's fine .\nSo the shape now .\nI mean it's\nIt looks like a\nbut I would say there is more  too much red .\nnow you took it .\nIt's too much red ?\nUm if\nIn the basement ?\nIt looks like a pineapple with cherry on top .\nOkay .\nRight . So , from one to seven ?\nI will give  I will\nMm uh  Seven is the ma the maximum ?\nI'll gi\nNo , seven is false and one is true .\nI'll give two or three .\nThree , I will say three .\nThree , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me .\nThree ?\n'Kay\nOkay .\nIsn't it bitter like that  ?\nThree .\nYeah yeah yeah .\nThen  uh let me\nWhat other\nThe other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .\nIs it easy to use ?\nFeasible ?  You said previously that you  there's um microphone inside an\nYe uh  Embedded .\nYeah , this is microphone array , in fact .\nIt's a micro array , okay .\nThere four microphone .\nOh . Okay ,\nSo they they they they  there's a microphone array .\nand you have the  there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?\nYeah , yeah .\nAnd you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?\nSo you can capture voice  yeah , you c\nOh yeah , yeah .\nYeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .\nAnd I think you  you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is  I\nYeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .\nW Yeah , but\nWe have tactile buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nI see , you have microphone array embedded . You have\nNo , that's good . Yeah .\nThat's good .\nOh , yeah .\nYeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe  okay .\nI think technically it's acceptable , so\nMaybe two ?\nYeah .\nSo using the same scale , two ?\nTwo ? I would say two\nTwo , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so .\n. You agree ?\nYeah , I agree .\nOkay .\nIt's better like that , isn't it ?\nNow maybe the most critical one .\nOkay .\nMost\nL last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ?\nEh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking .\nYeah , it's very easy .\nYou just need the command .\nYou can use this in this way .\nYeah but this this turning  can you can you just re explain me the\nAs a principle .\nYeah .\nPlease .\nTh this is the base .\nSo you can turn to change the channel .\nYeah . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?\nYou just tu turn d d\nI think maybe if you he\nOh , ok I understand .\nLike if you want to go from\nYou take take  the remote , so\nIf you hear some click\nand you can turn like that to change the channel ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah but imagine you y\nI think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast .\nYeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to  if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?\nOh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .\nYeah .\nHow can you go directly to twenty , for example ?\nNo , no , no . I  if y uh if\nYeah .\nit depend on the the angle you turn the\nYeah . I agree . I agree .\nYeah but y how  you need to know  I\nBut I mean if you're fro from two ?\nI if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five .\nI think something that  Yeah .\nYeah , you have a  , like that , and so on .\nSo change . Yeah .\nAnd you you can\nYeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh\nOh yeah .\nY uh fifth channel divided by the num by the  by three hundred thirteen degree .\nWe're not talking  Yeah .\nSo you got how many degree you you  it\nYeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go\nI think you can if you have a scale , so\nNo no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn ,\nMm-hmm .\nthen the angle you stop is the angle you  is the channel you\nYeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?\nIt's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the\nSo you you count  one degree , two degrees , no .\nYeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it .\nI don't think so .\nYeah , it's a bit difficult .\nI think so  I think so you can do it .  I think so , you can just change .\nI think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so\nYeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main\nThere's uh also a number , you know .\nYeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's  you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .\nUh , yeah , and y that's  yeah .\nBut if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it .\nAnd this would be more for browsing , ah .\nYeah .\nJust go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?\nYeah . To see uh\nMm-hmm .\nyeah  uh\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSeems to be good .\nYeah .\nGood choice , mister David Jordan .\nYeah .\nYeah , I mean you're famous . You  .\nAnd but I'd\nAnd also you can , if you i\nyeah , what's what's this cherry ?\nYou ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this .\nIt is a turn off t turn off button , maybe .\nFor this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this .\nIt's like fine , from coarse to fine .\nMm .\nThis is coarse , this is fine .\nYeah , yeah yeah . That's\nOkay .\nSo it's coarse to fine design .\nthat's very technologic , so .  Yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay the uh th this looks better . Yeah .\nYeah is is  this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel .\nS But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates\nThis is from one channel to\nmaybe one of the\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah , th you have the vocal commands .\nUh it's k\nYeah .\nOn off .\non off , yeah .\nYeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas\nMost of the time you have the  yeah it's a sleeping remote control .\nYeah , sleeping .\nAh , that's not the ecological part , yeah .\nThat's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah .\nTo compensate  .\nSolar .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSo\nSo , which number ?\nthree .\nEasy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three .\nDo you agree ?\nMm-hmm .\nThree ?\nYeah , agree , agree .\nSo reasonably , is four , is one ?\nThree f three for me , it's o it's okay .\nSo , three .\nFour or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and  no and just take the mean .\nAnd what's your opinion ?\nWill you give four ?\nUh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .\nFive ? Yeah , so maybe if\nUh w w what do y what uh  you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ?\nYeah .\nI think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have  you just turn the turn the ball .\nYeah but y you know\nThere's two kind of balls ,\nSo you have\nthe smaller the the the  so you can c you can c you can control the scale .\nyeah .\nBut in the traditional controller , how do  how can you control the scale ?\nUh by pushing zero after after the first one .\nYou just push two button , zero and and one .\nYeah ,\nAnd that's\nyeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .\nYeah .\nAre there some buttons ? Okay .\nYeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one .\nIt's not what you said previously .\nMm-hmm .\nPreviously you said that turning this was the fine\nYeah , if you're changing your mind .\nFine to coarse .\nFine to coarse .\nYeah , yeah .\nAnd from ten to ten channels here .\nY one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this .\nOkay .\nUh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc\nOkay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ?\nMm-hmm .\nThis has to stay on the table .\nIn fact on a flat place\nI i this is just a base . You can just\nYou can\nYeah .\nYeah but then uh when you turn turn it\nOh\nYeah , no no , no . You can't put it out .\nOh ye yes , that's right .\nJust  It's\nIt's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn .\nIt's impossible .\nOh\nYou need to put it on and turn .\nYeah . You know tha that's the weak point ,\nYou use your y\nbecause with a traditional one you just have one hand .\nYeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control .\nmy God .\nSo th this is a d next generation controller .  Yeah .\nNobody would take it .\nSure .  Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .\nSo nobody w will lost  lose it .\nyeah maybe , maybe may\nYeah .\nit's the next prototype , maybe we cou\nOkay okay , okay .\nS maybe we can change from th\nFour . Maybe four , it's okay .\nFour . Okay .\nFour ? Easy to use , four .\nI'll put four .\nGonna say four .\nFour .\nYeah , four it's more reasonable .\nUh it's even easier to  maybe .\nYou can you can erase with this er yeah .\nOk\nOkay .\nMm .\nYeah , four it's more reasonable , so . So it's nine ,\nSo , average ?\nnine over three .\nThree ?\nThree ?\nTrois . Three .\nOh yeah , it's  .\nTrois .\nOkay , so\nIt need maybe some wo further work , but it's\nYeah , especially on the easy to use\nYeah , uh s yeah .\nYeah .\ntarget .\nMight  it might be fine .\nSo , th the project is accepted ?\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah , b I think\nBut I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nIf you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSo uh mm mm .

Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved .\nThat's gonna be double curved , yeah .\nDouble curve , yeah , double curve .\nOne ?\nOne , you have .\nUh wood ?\nBut it's  yeah , a a rubber uh\nRather four buttons .\nUh do we need special colour ?\nOh no , interface .\nY maybe , two ? We have two special colours .\nYeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah .\nYeah , yeah that's special colours , sure .\nPush button .\nMm . Yeah , we have four .\nFive ?\nFive .\nOkay .  Scroll wheel . We don no .\nNo .\nIt it's more like integrated scor .\nI think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually .\nNo no .\nYeah tha that's wheel .\nY you tu you turn you turn it , so\nNo no no , it   Okay .\nYeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .\nYeah .\nYeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr\nSo , no button supplements ?\nI think the price is okay .\nNo .\nOkay .\nUm , no .\nOkay we  I think we have problem .\nL_C_ display , maybe . Interface .\nI think we s if we keep on adding things\nIt's okay .   fine  .\nso we have to\nYeah w one of the m key point is solar cells .\nMaybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?\nYeah .\nHas it changed .\nYeah , it was stage one , so .\nNo y i it did change , but\nOkay .\nWe have change the electronics to  from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh .\njust imagine we have\nSo\nWe have to delete the the sample sensor , I think .\nYeah , but we have  you  the the voice recognition ,\nYeah .\nno ?\nYeah but this one one of the feature we were not really\nYeah it's the one it's\nOkay .\nm maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version .\nI think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe .\nAdvanced version we have speak .\nYeah .\nBecause uh it seems that this can be\nYeah , if\nOr it would be better .\nyeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine .\nPlastic is free .\nYeah .\nSo , do we need special colour ?\nYeah , that's one of the requirement .\nBecause we have red .\nYeah , red and yellow .\nRed and yellow .\nWait .\nFancy .\nWe we can we can we c\nWe could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black .\nyellow .\nBlack then is a regular colour , so .\nI think so we need  if we try to have a kind of\nYeah , one .\npineapple bee .\nYeah . So push button then it's it's the next expensive one .\nYeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Integrated scroll wheel push button\nYeah , thi this might be .\n. So we'll  we have only one ? And push button .\nClose to .\nSo if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh\nOne . I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have  yeah .\nOkay , so what's the bottleneck ?\nHow about we change the sale ?\nDouble curved .\nDouble curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah .\nSomething flat .\nF some\nYeah , but flat\nS uncurved . Yeah , maybe not .\nSingle curve  .\nCase , what's the ca\nYeah .\nSingle curve should be fine , so . Oh , what\nMm . Nearly .\nAh we have one\nAnd then one Euro left .\nUm .\nMaybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells .\nIt's it's a bad idea , so .\nUm\nI think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one .\nTwo ?\nJust one .\nOne .\nYeah .\nThat's fine . That's fine .\nOkay . Okay .  Agree .\nSo  yeah , you will have\nSo we have one button ,\nOne s one scroll wheel , so\none wheel .\nSo one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it .\nAnd the vocal chord , it's fine .  It I th it's fine .\nSo\nIt's good they're not charging anything for that .\nSo , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is\nCou could we have look\ntwelve fifty e\nCould we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ?\nYeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half .\nYeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal .\nIt's fine . It's under or equal . It's fine , so\nOkay . Okay .\nOkay . So let's say\nTwelve fifty .\nWha what\nIt's fine , twelve fifty uh\nyeah . Which part is the most expensive part ?\nSolar cells .\nYeah , I think .\nThe solar cells , r is i is it ?\nYeah , I think it's not t t\nI think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be\nYeah , to be able to si to sell it .\nYeah .\nCheaper .\nThat's nice argument ,\nYeah , with mi\nbut if it's it's still four our of twelve .\nIt's  it is really really uh really very very expensive , though .\nYeah .\nMaybe if uh  okay .\nYeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so .\nOkay .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah but we just have one button .\nSo it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button .\nEasy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah .\nEasy , powerful .\nIt's easy to use . It's very easy to use .\nMm .\nSo I don't think we need to redesign the p the product .\nNo .\nUh that's what we've just done .\nWe've done it with  it is under the  if it was low , high or so .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo\nUm okay .\nNow\nSo  So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ?\nSo\nWell I think we have just have to discuss if\nOkay , okay , it's fine .\nI dunno .\nSo did you enjoy your clay modelling ?\nYes . Of course . This is my job .\nYeah ?  Was it a nice way to create your remote control ?\nYeah , it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer .\nYeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to  from the beginning to the end . And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very  informative for  .\nYeah .\nAnd for the marketing guy ?\nUh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe .\nYep  .\n'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff\nOkay .\nnext one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it  um .\nOkay , okay .\nAnd new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow .\nYellow .  I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after   a fruit T_V_ or I dunno .\nIt can be an interesting I don't know\nYes , just lemon .\nYeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be  yellow lemon .\nYeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um\nIt's flat , uh\nYeah yeah it's flat ,\nSquared ?\nyeah the shape is very boring .\nYeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah .\nCould we come up with new T_V_ with  such as this kind of T_V_ ?\nYeah .\nSo you can   you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can\nAh , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control .\nYeah , that's  that would be really interesting , actually .\nYeah . Yeah . Because the T_V_ you  also\nOh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device .\nDevice devi\nYeah .\nYeah , but just don't trust too much the trends .\nYeah .\nThe fruit ?  Yeah .\nMaybe\n'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh .\nYeah , maybe la next year it will be insects .\nYeah , it's\nMaybe two years it's dead .\nYeah .\nBut I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .\nYeah .\nMm .\nYeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product .\nYeah .\nT_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so .\nYeah , yeah . That's a  yeah , yeah .\nIf you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for\nWe can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .\nfifteen years\nCustomable T_V_ .\nYeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep\nYeah , yeah .\nAh such  yeah . You've already said mobile phones .\nOkay .\nTha that would that would make it . Yeah .\nYeah , you can keep the global appearan\nYeah , and following\nThe mood of persons , the fashions uh\nMm .\nYeah .\nIt's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr\nWe int    Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo what i and do w is it   Okay .\nSo I think the costs are within the budget . We're just at twelve fifty Euros .\nYeah , the pr  at\nYep .\nYeah .\nSo\ndo you think you can celebrate your creation ?\nAnd you can celebrate your leadership .\nOh , thanks a lot .  Thank you , mister David Jordan .\nYeah but I think f  it's really a celebrating object .  So it's yellow and very  a very ha it's very happy , so .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nUh it's it's a pr it's like  yeah .\nYeah . It's party party remote control .\nThe thing now is to to sell it .\nYeah , it's your job .\nYeah ,\nSell it .\nright , go and sell it . Goo and good luck , so\nYeah .\nYeah . Okay and the twelve fifty  twelve uh twelve\nUh-huh . Twenty five Euros .\nTwenty five Euros , yeah .\nIt should be fine .\nYeah , I think it's\nIt's maybe a little bit expensive .\nTwenty five Euros .\nIt's cheap , yeah .  No , I\nNo , it's not so expensive .\nI'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know .\nWh really ?\nIt should be it should be fine , you know , actually .  S\nOkay .\nMaybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come ,  it's really fruit .\nYeah .\nI I think I like  the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so\nBut don't put sugar in it , it's not working .\nOkay .\nNo , the colours are uh  it's perfect , yeah .\nIt's perfect , and\nTrue . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still .\nI p is th y\nYeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more  is most important ,\nthe the yellow ball thing that\nUh\nbecause I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control .\nStill that was one of the requirements we had . It's  yeah but it  I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .\nUh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_\nYeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .\nYeah .\nSo maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ .\nMm .\nOkay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so\nYeah .\nMm .\nSo we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics ,\nSo we have to give a\nso we have the slogan too .\nSo we have give him  give it a cute name .\nYeah\nth no , it's the it's the pineapple control  remote control .\nMush mushroom controller .\nCute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend .\nIt's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple .\nIt's not a mushroom .  It's a pineapple remote controls .\nIt's not the trend .\nPineapple .\nPa Pine apple .\nYeah , pineapple remote remote control .\nYeah , but just flying saucer , or\nWith cherry on top .\nOh , that\nOkay .\nI would say flying saucer .\nOh unid uh unidentified remote control , so\nIt's more appropriate , somehow .\nOkay .\nThat's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine .\nOkay .\nWill you buy one ?\nYeah . Yeah I will try  I'll try\nOkay .\nMm .\nTry to . Okay uh\nTwenty five  Euro .\n. I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage\nOkay . Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_\nYeah I always lose my  Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be\nso you need to buy one .\nOne thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket .\nOkay .\nMm .\nTraditional one ? Yeah . So this one and this one . What do you choose ?\nI prefer the laser remote control .  No .\nI think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's\nWhat do you choose ? Okay .\nit's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so .\nOkay .\nOh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd  can put light inside .\nYeah . Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea .\nYeah but that's going to be expensive , you know .\nYeah .\nWe had some problems  going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno .\n.\nI think it it would be interesting to  just to see if we can  if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah .\nYeah , afterwards , if\nYeah . Yeah .\nif it's a new trend . Okay .\nSo\nYeah that's that fine . So we can celebrate now . That's our new product .\nChampagne  , mister Baba .\nYes .\nWe should celebrate .\nIt's it's fine . It's  I like it  .  Next time .\nSo buy one .\nWell , I'll buy one here .\nYeah .\nSo\nMm .\nOkay , I will close this . Mm .\nYeah . No ?\nSo I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control\nOkay . Okay .\nYeah .\nand we have a nearly final product .\nOur final prototype which  yeah .\nFinal prototype , yeah , ye yeah .\nFinal prototype , right .\nPrototype , yeah .\nSo , thank you very much .\nOkay .\nOkay .  Okay .\nOkay .\nVery productive .\nOkay . Thanks .\nS so who is going to take the remote control ?", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "costs, budget, energy, cost, solar", "dialogue_id": 65}, {"text": "Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already .\nGood afternoon .\nI hope you enjoyed your lunch .  I did anyway .  Um let's see . Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes . Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? No ?\nNo .\nEverything fine ?\nThat's nice . Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials . Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out . And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ?\nSure .\nOkay .\nI'll start off then .\nGood luck .\nDoh . 'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and  Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the  These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . So this would be very important that we  at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really  This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . That would be all .\nOkay . Thank you . Any questions about the the trends ?\nAny questions ?\nMayb\nMm no .\nNo ? Okay , we go on to the next one .\nUm  'kay um yeah .  uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh  I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um  Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and  Uh  we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um  It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah . And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or  A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um  Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh  Um  Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um  See . Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button .\nSo um  D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of  looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the  So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh  Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so\nOkay .\nAnd that's it .\nUh thank you .\nOkay . About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall . Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it .\nOkay . Thank you . So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . Mm .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, presentations, presentation, designing, discuss", "dialogue_id": 66}, {"text": "'Kay . So these are the points we have to discuss . Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image .\nUh so uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think .\nYes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery .\nYeah .\nUh a hand dynamo .\nOkay  .\nBut I don't think that's  really an option .\nYou don't wanna swing before you can watch television .\nYeah .\nUh solar cells . But not every room is very light\nMm .\nso it's not a very good option .\nNo .\nOr the kinetic energy .\nYeah . Okay .\nAnd how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?\nWell y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up .\nYou just  You use it and it works .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nNah .\nOkay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .\nYeah . That's true .\nAnd besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete .\nOh .\nAnd I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product .\nYeah .\nBut\nUm wel\nwhat's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries  .\nYeah you could load up the batteries ,\nB b\nyou could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .\nOkay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough .\nUh\nUh so\nUh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place .\nThat's true .\nAnd I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms .\nOkay .\nSo maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .\nYeah . That's true . Yeah .\nAnd also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote .\nMm-hmm .\nBut I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station .\nYeah .\nSo you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .\nOkay .\nAnd then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .\nYeah . Uh .\nThat's safe .\nI'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?\nYeah . That's a good point .\nMm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .\nMm .\n'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .\nYeah , sure . Go ahead .\nUm so it was open here . Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that .\nNo .\nSo if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control\nMm .\nI would greatly advise not to do it .\nYeah .\nI think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the\nYeah .\nyounger people .\n'Kay .\nBut that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . It's a bit higher percentage , but\nUm well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nAnd I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .\nEasier to use ? No , I think that's a good point .\nBut uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ?\nUm well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones .\nOkay .\nSo pretty large .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information ,\nNo .\nand it's easy to ignore as well . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it .\nYeah .\nAnd um yeah I think the um  Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the  I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well .\nYeah .\nSo that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um\nMm-hmm .\nSo in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well .\nYeah .\nSo\nAnd that's the best choice .\nOkay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip .\nWell there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display .\nJust the advanced .\nSo it's gotta be advanced .\nOkay\n'Kay .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "energy, remotes, batteries, battery, remote", "dialogue_id": 66}, {"text": ", advanced chip . And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? Um as we saw there is not  Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce .\nMm-hmm .\nUm but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids .\nMm-hmm .\nLook I've got a new remote control , and uh\nUh I dunno .\nWell   And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood ,\nYeah . That's right .\nif it's just\nMm .\nwood-coloured .\nBut with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ?\nMm I dunno .\nYou don't know ?\nI'll have to uh research .\nI think so because  Yeah .\nProbably .\nIt's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .\nMm . Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh  Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it .\nYeah .\nSo\nChange the cases . Yeah .\nmaybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh\nYou can sell the cases .\nYeah .\nYeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the  Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever .\nYeah .\nBecause that's a  it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have ,\nYeah .\nwhich we can get a great advantage point .\nYeah that is true .\nSo and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well .\nYeah .\nYeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though .\nCosts .\n'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one .\nYeah . Yeah . So\nSo that would\nyou suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah  remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example .\nWell I wouldn't design a telephone\nbut\nWell no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um\nRemote .\none remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .\nYeah . Okay .\nSo , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem .\nSo everybody's okay with the changing covers ? I think that's a good uh good option .\nYeah .\nYes .\nChanging case covers .\nUm I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved .\nYeah .\nYes .\nCould you explain that a little more ?\nWell the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .\nAnd what would single curved and double curved mean ?\nUm it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality .\nOkay . So we can pretty much just do whatever we want .\nPick one you like , yes .\nMm . Okay .\n'Kay . That's good .\nUh but the form has to be um  It has to  It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ?\nNo just to lie down .\nokay .\nAnd the the cover of the the docking station is also\nWe'll go for that .\non top of the television then ? Or not ?\nWell or besides it .\nAnd you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the\nMm-hmm .\non the the board .\nMm .\nDoes somebody have ideas for a form or\nUh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um  Yeah .\nUm you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side ,\nYeah .\nso you could , so your thumb would be easily\nYeah .\nWell uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ .\nSo that would be great for that . Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .\nFor uh  Uh for\nFor left-handed users also .\nYeah yeah .\nYep .\nMm . Yeah we Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh  uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? Or  Or isn't it ?\nFor the volume . Um well\nMm .\nthat could  Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .\nUsabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult ,\nYeah okay .\nand then it's\nUh .\nBut if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote .\nMm .\n'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff .\nYeah\nBut you have extra buttons .\nbut\nSo people can get confused .\nYeah . Yeah .\nThat is true .\nYeah .\nEspecially if they have the same writings on it .\nSee um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh  For lefties\nCan't we make uh  Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same\nand   Um\nfunctions as the normal one ?\nYou mean um\nThen you have to\nYeah if\nLet's see if I ca A blank one . And then you get  Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . Uh now I have to think . It's a plus and a min . No it's not very handy I think . Because the plus and the min will be opposite\nMm no .\nand all kinds of\nYeah .\nYeah .\nNo that's not gonna work . I guess . Maybe we should\nUm\nYeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel\nYeah . That is true .\nor\nYeah . It's just uh u using uh your thumb .\nY yeah . Yeah .\nSo um it's\nI think we could just uh leave it a normal shape .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way .\nYeah . Um\nI think we should start by by choosing a case . Because that's the basis you're building on .\nYeah yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm yeah\nSo I could draw them out .\njust\nLet's look at the flat case . Oh . It's from the side so it's rather normal .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nThe the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . So this type should be better for you or better  Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .\nEasier ?\nAnd the double curved s looks something like this I guess .\nMm .\nSo th those are the three options we have .\n'Kay .\nMm .\nI suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in .\nUh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle .\nSo um  Do you say this um  S uh  Uh you got like uh sort of a  I believe   There ?\nMm-hmm .\nSo um you want to put a display over here ? Or not ?\nYeah . I think so . Yeah .\nYeah . Um  Yeah . Uh\nBut now it's\nwe can make it um\nDo you have it upside down or\nMm ?\nDo you have it\nThat's the top .\nthis that's top ? Okay .\nSo uh this top . This down . Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um  Let's see . Um  Colour uh okay . Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour .\nUm bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So um  Uh it's an\nYeah .\nSo so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and\nSo get your mouse . Yeah .\nAnd to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh\nYeah . That's a good one . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUh rem\nSo just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get   here .\nYeah but this place um\nIf you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down .\nUh it's  Yeah I dunno um\nBecause uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nIt's more logical to have it on top as well\nI think i\nbecause , like on your mobile phone , it's always above .\nYeah so\nOn top .\nYeah .\nSo\nYeah .\nOh maybe you should just s start on a blank page .\n. So\nYeah .\nthen we get  Here's  That's the curve .\nFive minutes .\nHere the display , and then buttons . Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . Just that's for left hand and right hand users .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd then h the rest of the buttons over here .\nYeah . But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh\nYeah still here\nYeah .\njus\nYeah .\nThat's\nAnd I'd prefer the corners to be round .\nYeah .\nYeah . 'Kay .\nShould be more bit more friendly ,\nThink that would be better .\nyeah .\nFriendly on the eye .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "wooden, wood, nokia, phones, colour", "dialogue_id": 66}, {"text": "'Kay .

So check out the corporate website maybe . The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach .

I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or  I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first .\nYeah .\nAnd then you'll get a message .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo that's uh basically it . Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the folders group . Uh yes , it's here .\nYeah .\nSMARTboard , there it it .

Uh first of all I'll start with the costs ,\n.\nbecause that's going to influence our design .\nOh no .\nOh ,  .\nIf you  Don't know if you al already had a look or not ?\nNo n I I already did it .\nDid you do your questionnaire already ?\nNo .\nIt's not much . It's just one question .\nBecause we have a problem .\nUh\nOh .\nIf you look closely , you can see .\nYeah .\nIt wants\nUm I already took the liberty to make some suggestions .  .  .  At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . Uh we use kinetic energy . And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ?\nNo that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look . So\nOkay . Uh\nYeah but everything is .\nShould we switch to a hand dynamo ?\nUh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things .\nNo .\nYeah , b but\nYeah but young people like that .\nBatteries ?\nSo just do normal battery .\nBatteries .\nI think the battery option .\nJust a normal battery then , yeah .\nYeah .\n.\nIt has to be twelve and a half .\nYeah .\nOr not ?\nOh .\nSo\nOh my goodness .\nYou're going to redesign something .\nOh no .\nOkay , so we're at twenty five .\nUh , yeah .\nUm  Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ?\nWell I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything .\nMm-hmm .  Uh\nBut we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat ,\nYeah .\nand the screen screen is just  Well you just have to hold it like this then . So\nYeah . Um\nHow about  Sorry .\nUh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros .\nThat's what I was thinking .\nYeah .\nAlright .\nYeah ?\nA a\nLet's do it then . Yeah .\nUh then we have left\nBut we don't have any basic options any more .\nwe\nUh yeah . We do .\nAnd uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well .\nF_ eight .\nThey don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it .\nYeah .\nYou were saying something .\nThat was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one\nYeah .\nI mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nAnd then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click\nYeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons .\nBut um  Now let's look .\nYeah we c could  We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So  With the display .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah we need one integrated button for everything then .\nYeah .\nThe joystick .\nUh\nYeah . Kind of . I was  Because\nYeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh\nYeah . If you if you go to\nIntegrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah .\nIf you go to our uh view , like you  if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nthis is just uh an example ,\nMm-hmm .\ny y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nBut you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound ,\nYeah .\nright ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound .\nYeah .\nSo you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button .\nYeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button .\nYeah .\nSo that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it .\nExactly .\nBut you still  But you then still need to have  Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um\nYeah it's r Yeah .\nYou still have to have some some button in the menu to go back .\nSo you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button .\nYeah .\nAnd then just drop all the other buttons .\nUh yeah .\nWell not all .\nBut but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons .\nNot s not sound I guess .\nNo .\nYeah . It's uh  One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button .\nYeah .\nMm .\nSo\nSo we have to to make it s uh more uh  It has to be\nYou could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back .\nYeah . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ?\nOh , that's for the speech .\nSpeech recognition .\nYeah .\nCould drop the speech recognition .\nRight .\nS s Drop speech recognition ?\nNo but\nYeah that's possible .\nWe we d\nYeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons .\nButtons .\nButtons .\nThat's not very easy to use .\nYeah .\nI\nNo , it can be disturbed by by noise and\nNo .\nYeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works .\nstuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition .\nYeah .\nI have to look on that . Let me see .  Uh well no I was wrong .\nThere are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen .\nYep . Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we  need a lot of\nBut if it   But it it  it's a it's a both a hypers\nWe lose our whole concept .\nYeah .\nUh so  No we just\nWe need a lot of extra buttons .\nNo , but\nWe keep the L_C_D_ .\nWell we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six .\nOkay\nWe uh we we haven't really integrated this  the speech into the system ,\nso we drop the speech .\nso we can might as well s drop that .\nAnd drop it yeah ?\nYeah .\nYeah . Let's drop the speech .\nOkay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose .\nSixteen Euros .\nWe need to lose some buttons .\nBut y y\nYeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button  Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button .\nYeah . Yeah .\nThen you're\nAnd then and then use um\nOh and the power button we have also .\nThe the  Okay . And the menu button does also does the okay function then .\nYeah .\nAnd then when you in the menu\nSo that's one Euro .\nS so so you activate the menu .\nIf we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons .\nYeah . Yeah ? And\nWith with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera .\nYeah yeah .  Yeah .  .\nThat would save zero point two Euros compared to  No .\nNo it's three Euros . No ? Um\nYeah . To This together is more expensive than  Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this .\nNo it's it's n Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah .\nAnd we can drop these two .\nWell okay .\nIt's the\nFor example if you have f f four buttons ,  channel up and down , uh volume left right\nVolume .\nOkay , I've  I think we have to keep that .\nAnd the power button .\nAnd then  and the power button . So that's five .\nThat's the basic .\nThat's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back . Or or under each option , you set a  you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back .\nSo that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button .\nYep . Okay th that's\nBut we can't drop three buttons .\nWhich   That's even\nBut I see that's\nYeah that's one Euro more expensive .\nYeah .\nSo    that's not a good idea .\nThat's not an option .\nBecause which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then\nMenu , power .\nYeah . F of the four things ?\nFour arrows ?\nYeah , th power .\nPower . Uh\nYeah , if you if you go to eight\nWhich more ?\nI don't know how to\nYeah . Okay . So four arrows ?\nYeah .\nUh power I believe ?\nPower . Th Yeah that's five .\nUh  We have a Back and a Okay button .\nYeah , okay that's seven ,\nAnd the Menu .\nand one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display .\nYeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So\nOh , well okay . Yeah .\nYeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display .\nThe L_C_D_ ? Yeah .\nLet's make the  Let's make the case plastic .\nYeah well we need the advanced\nThen I rather make it wood .\nInstead of r\nBecause then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people .\nYeah .\nYeah . True .\nYeah but but that's not our market .\nBut\nNo that  maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway .\nAh no , hard plastic .\nPlastic with a with a special colour .\nOh .\nA woo wood uh wood uh wood colour .\nYeah , plastic with special colour .\nYeah ?\nNo but I I\nYeah okay uh\nThat's an option .\nBecause we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that .\nYeah .\nYep . Yeah , yeah .\nSo we do one one s\nSo let's go for the plastic .\nYeah .\nYeah , okay . Plastic .\nAnd since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ?\nUh that's easy because plastic is free .\nHmm .\nHmm .\nWe still have problem of two Euros .\nYeah , okay . Uh if we dropped uh\nNo the buttons , those are really needed .\nYeah ?\nYeah th th it's it's uh\nYeah we can't drop them .\nAn advanced chip-on-print .\nYou still need that .\nYeah uh\nDo we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ?\nYou  uh uh  Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and  Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total .\nS\nThat doesn't matter .\nOh . I rather keep I rather keep the display .\nNo , I keep the re Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So\nWell yeah .\nSo the only option is an hand dynamo .\nExactly .\nOh that\nYeah and something else .\nYeah but the\nOh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right .\nuh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . And then if w\nAnd then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use .\nNo y you would rec\nI mean it's not that important , easy to use , but\nThen you have\nTh then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ?\nThen you still need two additional buttons I believe .\nAnd uh\nYeah .\nFor the volume .\nYeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power .\nYou can use those  Yeah .\nBut the\nOh yeah and power . That's three buttons and this would cost\nOh . Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now .\nBut the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ?\nYeah . Three . Up , down , Okay .\nYeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on .\nOkay .\nYou can go into you in you main menu ,\nYou you press it for like three seconds .\nyou can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options .\nThen then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen .\nYeah .\nYeah , okay . It would save enough\nMaybe we should . 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen .\nYeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left .\nYeah .\nSo we can maybe still use power button .\nYeah , but we'd   Alright .\nYeah .\nI guess we have to .\nIt s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half . So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half .\nYeah . You see ?\nWe'll we'll be on\nBut we still have thirteen left .\nOh still  Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah .\nThirteen . So still half .\nShit . Drop the special colour .\nThere goes the special co\nOh no .\nWell   That would make it less appealing . So that's no option .\n'Kay . What else ? Uncurved ?\nNo no , it has to be um curved .\nWe sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ?\nYeah .\nYeah it says right here .\nThey made it very easy for us .\nOkay .\nWell yeah .   yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature .\nAh , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than\nOkay . Wh what we could do is um  drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons .\nYeah .\nButtons . That's  Oh yeah since we only have one button .\nYeah .\nYeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ?\nI just m I don't  I think\nJust something else than than black or white I think .\nUh yeah it's  I think it's grey , regular .\nS yeah . Alright .\nGrey and rubber .\nBut we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though .\nOf plastic .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nDamn .\nSo I rather have an hand dynamo  than than drop the colour .\nYeah and then\nYeah .\nYeah yeah yeah yeah .\nYou can still play with it then I guess . I don't know .\nYeah .\nYeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option .\nThe display\nWell , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it .\nYeah .\nThe  But if you have to power the for ten minutes ,  then the\nYeah .\nI don't know .\nYeah .\nNo I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no .\n.\nYeah .\nYeah true .\nYeah .\nLet's let's go for the hand dynamo then .\nYeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ?\nOr or do we  Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of\nNo no it has to be curved .\nYeah .\nYeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour .\nYeah . Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something .\nYeah .\nAnd a screen .\nYeah . That's the most import\nYep ? Instead of an additional power button ?\nYeah or spe special form ?\nYeah . S what what is special f Oh yeah , special form .\nYeah ?\nMaybe that's nicer .\nIt's for scroll\nYeah .\nWithout\nBut we don't have any buttons .\nWe only have\nSo do\nYeah . But it's it's for the integrated button , I think also . Or\nd Uh make it a special colour then .\nYeah but\nYeah ma make it a special colour then .\nYeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So\nYeah . Okay . Yeah .\nOkay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy .\nYeah ? So\nYep .\nWoah we're within budget .\nSo   Yeah .\nIt's a miracle .\nOh just\nLet's let's save it .\noh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nLet's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we\nYeah ?  Okay . Um , well   . 'Kay , this was old .\nWell we come back to the drawing board then , huh ?\nYeah .  Okay .\nYeah all your designs are uh pretty much\nYeah back to work . Uh\nDid I save it ?\nIt's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing .\nYeah .\nYeah but that but that's the fun part of it .\nI I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed .

Uh so\nUh you put it in the  .\nWe all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the  Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements .\nYeah .\nAlright .\nF_ five .\nLet's make it big .  Um  Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a  scale , as we all know it .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now .\nAlt up\nYeah . I don't know it's open yet . No . And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ?\nFreaky .\nOh . I don't know . Um  Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . How do you think about that ?\nI think it does . Because the operating  behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ ,\nYeah .\nright ?\nUh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh\nYeah the us u It it\nYeah .\nit's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question .\nMm-hmm .\nSo do you think\nWell , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So\nYeah . You can you can ma\nYep .\nYeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen .\nI  No .\nSo on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ?\nTwo or three . Two or three .\nHuh ? Two or three ? Something like that ?\nTwo .\nYeah .\nWell we have to choose one . So uh what do you say ?\nUh y we should fill this in now .\nI agree on two .\nYeah okay .\nYeah .\nUh\nI uh I say two , personally . But\nYeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two .\nYeah .\nYeah alright .\nYeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now .\nOkay then I say three .\nYeah ? You say three ,\nYeah yeah .\nand you you said al also three ?\nYeah .\nThree ? Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then .\nHey , you're marketing , eh .\nYeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's  nah , it's not very clear on the sc\nHmm . M maybe underline .\nOr give it a colour .\nMaybe other colour , yeah . That's better .\nRed .\nUh  Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore .\nOh yeah very true .\nAlright . Yeah .\nYeah true one .\nUm well the remote control has   Wha\nHe types everything .\nDefinitely one . It has to be .\nYeah .\nThe remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings .\nIt hides uh basic functions .\nEverything .  You don't use anything else .\nYeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function .\nYou're not gonna find them .\nYeah . Yeah okay . Yeah .\nYeah true .\nBut , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . And you place them\nMm-hmm .\nF I don't know where . So that's very true , I guess , for our case .\nYeah the next  Not so much so .\nUh the second point . It shows the relevant and most used functions .\nNope .\nPower button . Do we ha still have a power button ?\nUh check with the Excel sheet .\nWell yeah the button's integrated , huh ?\nI think we are\nYeah . Yeah it's uh it's integrated .\nYeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for\nIt's in  Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah .\nYeah integrate it .\nYeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then\nYeah .\nE exactly just like a m mobile .\nYeah . I don't know .\nJust go scrolling and it will activate .\nYeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions .\n.\nYeah uh on the other  uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . So it's  I don't know .\nIt shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but\nCan you uh change channels directly with with just one button ?\nYeah .\nNo , you have to scroll through the menu , before\nWith the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . And then\nYeah . So it's it's not\nWell uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if  When it's on , yeah , it's turned on ,\nYou say you double click on the\nHmm ?\nIt automatically has the the programme and the volume function ,\nYeah .\nbut as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some   Of you\nYeah .\nOr you double click it .\nBut but how do you change from volume to channel ?\nNo because it has four arrows , right ?\nNo , not anymore .\nNo .\nNo .\nBecause he's  now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in .\nOh yeah .\nYeah .\nLike on the the mouse .\nYeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick .\nNo we have n we have no buttons left . So\nSay .\nthe joystick was not an option .\nYeah that is a bummer .\nSo   so you hav\nYeah .\nSo you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume ,\nTo get into menu . Yeah .\nand three double click for the menu , or something .\nOh no .\nOr hold it ten seconds .\nWe'll make it a Morse code .\nYeah .  Yeah . Yeah . Alright .\nBut but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you .\nNo no no . Uh it should be trendy .\nSo that's\nYeah but that that's not a question .\nUh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions .\nWell I think it's pretty much in the middle .\nYeah . Four .\nYou have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So\nYeah , im  in the menu .\nSeven .\nYeah .\nSo maybe it's more like a f a five . Or\nYeah . Five .\nYeah I would go for five or six , yeah .\nYeah . Five or six ?\nFive .\nFive . Yep .\nOkay five .\nFive ? Alright .\nLet's not diss our remote .\nYeah .\nIt's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So\nOh .  Yeah .\nYep . Just one button .\nWell it's different .\nYeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition .\nBut  Uh yep .\nYeah .\nWell yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation .\nYeah , it's still  Yeah , I say two .\nYeah .\nWe still have the fruit and vegetable print .\nI say two then .\nOh , that's the next .\nYeah but   that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question .\nFr Oh I mean the  Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost .\nThis one .\nI think a two . No .\nTwo .\nTwo yeah .\n.\nYep .\nI think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech\nYeah definitely .\nWhat ? Oh not the bold one .\nIt's way more practical , yeah .\nRight . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material .\nYeah .\nIt should have been two questions .  I realise now , because  sponge-like material is dropped .\nBut the look and feel\nYou still have rubber d Or no .\nYeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button .\nNo you got a plastic .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThe button has also colour . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah ?\nThe one button we have .\nOkay .\nYeah . The one .\nYeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve .\nYeah you could check with the Excel sheet .\nMm mm .\nYeah . You only have one  Yeah .\nYeah we have single curve now ,\nAnd and colour .\nand no and no material\nYeah . S\n. So maybe in the middle or something .\nYeah .\nFour . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , I mean it's\nYeah or three .\nUh\nworth the  Yeah .\nWe have something .\nActually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard .\nYeah .\nI mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh .\nNew . Yeah .\nYeah . But then we would have to drop the screen .\nRed .\nOh red . Yeah .\nYou like both .\nYeah .  I like bold .\nUh the remote control displays the corporate logo .\nUm oh yeah .\nMm yeah yeah .\nOf course .\nI just couldn't\nYeah .\nYou just have to draw it .\nUm , just one minute .\nIt's the white part uh\nYeah but it  be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the\n.\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo\nWe have a we have a\nSo I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But\nBut there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean ,  if there's only one thing .\nHell yeah . If we have only one button .\nYeah . So I will say that is very true .\n.\nMm-hmm .\nAnd even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ ,\ndoesn't it ?\nYeah .\nSo\nThe remote control is easy to use . Well I would say\nNo .\nSkill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so .\nThe only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button .\nAh i\nYeah .\nAnd that you only have to control one button .\nYeah exactly .\nYeah . It it it has a nice screen . But  Yeah .\nIt gives visual feedback . So\nYeah . Well I I would say a five or a six .\nI think a five . Five .\nI would say six .\nWhat do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ?\nIt's really not easy to use .\nNo not anymore .\n'Cause you're putting everything\nSo a six , more .\nYeah .\nYeah , uh I would go for the six too . So\nOkay . Yeah .\nMost votes count . Um\nUm well , another question ,\nYeah that looks uh great .\nuh the remote control is durable .\nI don't know if that's the correct word .\nYeah . Nah\nDefinitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic\nBut uh  In use , both battery as casing ?\nYeah . Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever .\nYeah ? True , true .\nAnd the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever .\nAnd the casing is plastic ,  ?\nYep .\nYeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long .\nYeah .\nSo I would go for one .\nYeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate\nYeah . S\nYep .\nOkay yeah .\nthan\nWow .\nYeah . Logo .\nYeah .\nOkay I will go  go for two .  Uh the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics .\nOh . No m\nNo we put the electronics into the fashion .\nYeah well  yeah .\nI would g\nuh   turn around . Yeah . But um\nI would go for four .\nNo\nYeah ?\nBecause we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have .\nIt's not   Yeah , true .\nYeah okay .\nSo a four . It's   it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess .\nYeah .\nBut it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so\nYeah . Yeah yeah .\nYeah , four is okay .\nAlright , yeah . Right .\nSo\nThat's it .\nSo if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers .\nOoh . And  Yeah ? What ?\nUh  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh\nYeah .\nOh  Alright . Word document , the\nYeah . That\nYeah we have to count them .\nCount them . Add them ? Or\nUh  Yeah just add them and then uh divide them .\nCould somebody start calculator ?\nYeah . Mm .\nAh we can do the math . Uh\nI all made it po I I all made it\nI all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it .\nMm-hmm .\nI mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale ,\nYeah , yeah . You have to\nuh  Yes .\n'Kay . So four and\nYeah . Did you make this questionnaire or what ?\nYeah .  Thanks .\nNice work .\nOkay .\nOh .\nThree plus ?\nI wouldn't be able to do it that fast .\nO one .\nPlus one .\nPlus five .\nPlus five ?\nOh  Easy .\nBo\nQuestion number four , yeah ?\nUh two .\nYeah .\nFour .\nOh . Wait a second . Oh .\nF\nIt's it's gone wrong .\nHow hard is it ?\nOkay . It's your turn .\nPretty difficult .\nYeah just use\nStart over ?\nNo it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s\nOh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads .\nYou can  Oh yeah .\nNo . That's why it's uh\nIt's a it's a bit uh\nJust type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together .\nYeah . I think you can just count them by a\nJust count it to   Yeah .\nUm let's move over .\nOkay . Three , four , nine .\nThree , plus one , four . Nine .\nUh\nUh , yeah . Are you here ?\nEleven .\nEleven .\nEleven ,\nFifteen .\nFifteen .\nfifteen .\nSixteen .\nSixteen .\nSixteen , yeah .\nSeventeen .\nSeventeen .\nNo sixteen . Uh sixteen plus six .\nOh what ?\nTwenty two .\nS Uh\nHow hard is this ?\nTwenty two . Twenty two , yeah ?\nTwenty four . Twenty six .\nNever mind . Twenty four . Twenty eight .\nTw\nOh , sorry .  .\nTwenty  Twenty eight .\nThat was the last one . That was that .\nOh my .\nTwenty eight .\nYeah .\nOkay . Twenty eight .\nSo divided by nine .\nTwen Uh okay . By nine .\nHmm .\nThat's uh three uh   Or le less than a three .\nSo\nYeah the lower the  The lower the score the better , right ?\nYeah .\nYeah . Twenty eight\nYeah but\nDivided by nine .\ndi divided by nine\nSo thr t two .\nmakes three point one one one one one one one .\nSo we're better than average .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "agenda, evaluation, presentation, innovation, design", "dialogue_id": 67}, {"text": "But\nYeah .\nI Are you sure we  this number actually tells us somethings ?\nNo .\nI don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative .\nSome questions are  Yeah .\nSo if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low  the lower the better .

So\nYeah true .\nYes , so the  It tells us something , yes . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess .\nOh great .\nThings , yeah .\nYeah definitely definitely .\nOkay .\nBecause now it's just an average  It's remote .\nYeah . Nah it it's it's better than average , but\nYeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . But uh it looks and stuff , it still uh\nYeah . So th\nIt's still  yeah .\nYeah .\nHas some shortcomings .\nit's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour .\nNo .\nThe colour and the screen .\nYeah .\nOkay so   Um this we had , this we had . We have to do a product evaluation .\nProduct evaluation .\nUh prototype presentation we dropped . So  Uh the finance we looked . We have redesigned . Uh not on that , but\nYeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this\nSo you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen .\nOkay it's your turn now .\nShall we try ?\nWith some casing around it , yeah .\nBlack . Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ?\nYeah uh\nYeah .\nBut are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ?\nYeah .\nYeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh\nThe the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour .\nYeah .\nhe only needs one button .\nOne scroll button and\nIt's plastic .  And single curved .\nYeah . Or we have to delete this one or\nYeah .\nOh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED .\nOh  oh no .\nOh yeah .\nOtherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well .\nFor what ?\nOkay .\nYeah .\nSo that's\nDo we have to do other things ?\nWell I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far .\nOr just redesign ?  Alright .\nAnd I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet .\nYeah .\nSo I\nSo you made a start , right ?\nYeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me .\nShould give it some time ?\nYeah .\nYay .\nUh\nOkay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ?\nI was here . So\nIt's just one\nHave to take this away also .\nAlright .\nyeah .\nAh\nAnd this um\nUh that's the infrared uh  thing .\nOh yeah , of course .\nThe the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape .\nYeah .\nUm pen yeah ? Format . Current colour red .\nThe playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour\nOh  Yeah we did our special colour for the\nYeah .\nOkay .\nLine widths , now that's a ten .\nThat's conceptual , yes .\nThat's enough to get started with , so\nYeah . Um , uh it's just a scroll\nMm .\nIt's gonna be one str scroll .\nYeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ?\nHow many pages ?\nUh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion .\nI think\nAlright . Y you have you have done the first two .\nHorizontal's easier too ,\nYeah .\n'cause you can\nOkay , and and the look and feel is\nYeah .\nIs it more natural than this ?\nWell I think I have to make a p an issue called finance .\nYeah , yeah .\nSo let's say  Whoops . 'Kay .\nYeah .\nYes .\nBasically .\nIt doesn't look like uh\nThe items we had to drop .\nYeah .\nUh it  it's it's not  Yeah . It's not very fashionable anymore . But uh it's okay .\nIt's really ugly .\nYeah .\nWhere did we start with price ?\nMaybe m make it bigger ? Or\nTwenty six and a half .\nMm-hmm .\nOr not ? Or twenty six ? Something like that .\nYeah . That looks little bit more uh  Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it uh special ?\nOh\nThis ?\nWhat do you mean ? Like a other colour than this one ?\nOr or speckles in it ? I dunno . Uh\nSpeckles ?\nYeah can we do it uh  uh can we do a print ?\n..$ I'm not sure .\n... . I don't think so , if you see the options . But\nI think we have to choose , yeah ?\nUh\nOkay special colour . We do have special colour .\nYeah red is already a special colour , I think . So\nDoes it mean uh that\nIt's not very special , but uh\nYeah .\nShall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ?\nYeah . Just uh put the purple uh purple on it .\nPurdy .\nYeah . Some some big dots .\nPurple ?\nThat's trendy .\nYeah yeah .\nYeah .\nOh no my remote has acne .\n... . We have the original balance sheet , or\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWoah .\nNo . That's why we have that button .\nOh yeah .\nIt's so cute .\nHmm . Oh what ?\nDoh .\nWoah .\n?\nJust cut . Control Z_ .\nOh no .\nIs that that ?\nYeah .\nNo no . Yeah .\nYeah .\nHow the  We  did we do that ?\nOh it's it's just one computer ? Or\nJust dual screen .\nNo . But can we delete it , just with delete ? Or\nWe can try .\nThat doesn't respond also to the undo . It looks like it's\nCrashed .  Oh , no .\nNo ,\nVery nice .\nOkay .\nWhere do you want some more dots ?\nYeah , over here .\nYou can't even draw anymore .\nHmm ?\nYeah . Y y you you\nWhat's this ?\nEven children can draw .\nyou push the button or something . Or\nCan you just push pen and then keep on\nOh yeah . Oh that's the select button .\nHmm .\nIt's uh\nOkay , it's not the prettiest , I know .\nNo , it looks\nIt's not so random huh ?\nLot of options .\nIt's okay . Specially the the R_ .\nYeah , the R_ and another R_ .\nYeah okay .\nIt's called the Real Remote , right ?\nYeah .\nMaybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote .\nYeah just on the the m um the L_C_D_ display .\nYeah .  Welcome .\nThis is your Real Remote .\nWe can make a l a logo .\nYeah .  Yeah .\nLike uh  put it like the shape .\nYeah .\nD designed by\nSomething like that .\nOkay .\nI mean it's not too uh  That's not their logo , is it ?\nNo . Do they have a lo  Oh , the  here . This i this is the logo .\nYeah .\nTwo R_s and a one\nIt's a\nYeah . You can just reuse that , because the name is the same . Initials .\n.\nYou can copy and paste the picture if you want .\nHow   Shall we do the logo in black or not ?\nMm .\nYeah .\nYeah .  What is that ? Look more  Looks more like a campfire .\nAre you dissing my drawing ?  This one ?\nYeah .\nIt looks like a ribbon .\n. Yeah .\nOkay .\nSo who wants to draw ? This is actually quite fun . Do we need to do anything ?\nAre we uh ready ? Uh  Or\nI hear you people are typing .\nType in your report .\nOh , okay .\nI don't see any new messages . So\nLuckily .\nHmm ? Luckily , yeah .\nIs this uh the last assignment ? Or\nYeah , it's uh\nFinal\nYeah .\nIt's almost four .\nWhat time do we have to deliver the report ? Four o'clock or\nAt four , yeah ,  ?\nOr before that ?\nOkay . And copy this .\nJust compare uh\nJust a minute .\nThis is really bizarre .\nIt's\nIt looks like there's a  It looks like a butterfly .\nUm bug . Bug .\nIt's somewhere  I d It isn't inside .\nNo it's in inside the\nYeah , and don't know how it's  or eject it .\nNo it's on the on the beamer I guess .\nNo it  Oh .\nFrom up there ?\nNo , but it i It's not a bu a beamer .\nNo .\nB It's a normal T_V_ screen , kind of thing .\nYeah it's somewhere in here .\nHey , you've got it uh read only . So you have to uh\nSave copy .\nYeah . Strange . This something what's projection from behind , I guess .\nYeah .\n.\n.\nIt's too uh\nOh . Yeah there is some kind of projection I think .\nYes .\nYeah it it's a beamer , but then with a\nWith a with a mirror , huh ? Or something .\nwithin a mirror , yeah .\n.\nYeah .\nSo it looks like a big screen , but   in fact it isn't .\nSo are we gonna change anything to this ?\nIt is\nI mean is it gonna\nWell it's it's single single curved .\nWell\nIt's now single curved . So  It's flat . Oh no .\nThis is gonna be flat . Yeah exactly .\nTh this is flat . Yeah .\nOkay . It doesn't matter . It's it's\nBut it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice .\nI mean you see more of this than of that .\nYeah .\nYeah , more like that .\nYeah . And this is also gonna be\nIt's not very uh ideal .\nNope .\nDo like this .\nBut sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work .\nYeah . What's this ?\nThat's the detector uh for the\nOoh .\nOkay .\nMaybe\nBut I don't see a detector over there .\nYeah . I don't know .\nNo it's  I think you only need two points . Or not . No , you sh\nI thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something .\nMaybe that's why it's it's not working , because it's more\nSlanted yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .  Or just messed it up .\nWell maybe .\nOh .  Oh yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah it it matters for the aim of this thing .\nYeah .\nYeah but it wasn't good .\nYou've to make it s uh ninety degrees .\nYeah it it has to touch the corners , I guess . But th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here .\nUm now you probably have to recalibrate .\nYou have\nOh , five minutes to the end of the meeting .\nOh we're always long .\nOh .\nAnd the recalibration is done using this icon here .\nYeah , can we t can we get to that @ i\nOoh .\nOh it's not working anymore .\nYeah well I just\nYeah yeah , it's it's okay . It's working again .\nOh yeah yeah yeah yeah , it's it's working , it's working .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nIt's better than before .\nWe're improving uh  Yeah .\nYeah .\nYou go ahead .\nYeah .\nYeah that's improved uh pretty much .\nYeah it's only a bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way .\nYeah . Yeah but it's better , it's better\nNo it\n'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there .\nMm . No . It's better than it was I guess .\nMm-hmm . I will take this away 'cause it looks messy .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "positive, questions, mean, negative, innovation", "dialogue_id": 67}, {"text": "Silly . Yeah . Works pretty well . Five minutes before the meeting's over .\nYeah . Yeah .\nAnd then ?\nThen I have to uh uh write this ,\nWe have to present\nand I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far .\nAlright .\nMaybe we will .\nMaybe we get a a final mail .\nSo it  after the  after after these five minutes , you have to\nYeah .  Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report .\nWhat's this anyway ?\nSo cake .\nAlright . After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or\nIt looks like candle wax .\nYeah .\nAlright . And we uh\nAnd you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or\nRight . Chill .\noh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate .\nHuh .\nYou can just if you ma finish my presentation please . Uh over there .\nUh  Yeah ?\nThe presentation is still open . So if you finish that then you'll see uh  Yeah next .\nNext slide .\nOh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . Just uh do that quickly .\nYeah ?\nUh\nHow do you do it ?\nUh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um\nAlright .\nSo how were  did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there uh\nUh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or\nYeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth .\nYeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast .\nYeah .\nBut then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd the third time yeah , I mean\nAnd we move more to to working together as team ,\nNo .\nMm-hmm .\nbecause at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make .\n.\nNo .\nYeah , yeah yeah yeah .\nAnd then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that ,\nMm-hmm .\nand you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So\nYeah .\nYeah we\nThe process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . Especially after the first meeting .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd\nYeah , especially if f f if you see  uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah . Definitely .\nOkay and was that due to my leadership ?\nYeah yeah yeah .\nWell you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that\nYeah ?\nYeah .\nYeah . You were more in charge kind of thing .\nThat okay ?\nYeah .\nOkay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ?\nI guess so .\nYeah .\nYeah but only the the financial parts uh\nI mean\nLi Limiteded afterwards ,\nYeah .\nbut  If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity .\nI\nAlso not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh\nWe were pretty democratic .\nthe the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that .\nSo and the  uh about the board  digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or\nYeah .\nOoh .\nMm uh I think in in essence\nthe digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better .\nYeah it works .\nI mean uh uh I've made  yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly .\nYeah .\nSo it it's better a better device than uh\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe  Yeah .\nthan the screen . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well .\nIt's uh it's  The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen .\nUse the pen .\nAnd uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation .\nYeah .\nBut once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . Or uh something like that . You can give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the the logo and everything .\nYeah yeah .\nAnd  I don't know .\nYep .\nBlink . Oh .\nWarning . Finish meeting now .\nFinish meeting .\nOkay , are are there  any new ideas about this ? All I think\nWell , it\nI didn't really receive , yeah .\nIt's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff .\nUh uh w uh\nAnd and\nS sorry uh\nthe  screen and stuff like that .\nMm-hmm .\nI think the PowerPoint is is too limited . You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . It has to be uh  yeah . The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily\nYeah .\nYeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYou know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever .\nYeah . Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an  a small audience , and then to\nYeah just for text , for text it's uh it's okay . But\nYeah . These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . So\nOh .\nYes . Check your email .\nUh we should uh enter our questionnaire .\nYou also .\n'Kay .\nAh .

That's why our product will always fit in your home . So apparently we need to  um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market .

I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's  actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . Like you see here , I'll just take the  take  here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want . It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just  either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . So it should be really easy .\nOkay .\nThis is to take the  just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be  it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out .  Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . So next , been here .  Well ,  gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So basic idea is we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . I think the creative genius should go first .\nThe creative genius ?\nThank you very much .\nSo , draw us your favourite animal .\nWell , I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing ,\nso I'm not really good at drawing animals ,\nDraw us a technical animal .\nbut uh the animal which I   Oh .\nYeah , it's still erasing .\nPen .\nUh format .

It's like uh it's a very  Uh high-tech .\nBit low-responsive though .\nSo that's what we don't want .\nPrefer pen and paper .\nWe want a high-responsive product . So  It looks more like nuclear bomb .\nVery nice dolphin .\nIt   doesn't look like a nuclear bomb .\nThis thing isn't doing what I'm  What I want .\nLet's go easy on it .\nSo   Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .\nI'll just finish up real soon , because I'm\nSo it doesn't really look like a dolphin ,\nAnyway ,\nbut then again , this is all new for me .\nit should  It  It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it  that it represents .\nUh-huh .\nLike the ocean , like swimming . Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an\nWhat do you like ? Okay . Well ,\nNow we can forget this ever happened .\nour Marketing Expert . Show us an animal .\nUm an animal .\nPick a  pick a\nI like the elephant .\npick a clean sheet . Oh . Take a clean sheet first .\nWhat ? Yeah . Um\nJust press next . That's it .\nOh yeah . Oh , a blank . Okay , next . Free , I like the elephant . It's big , it's strong , so uh uh  Oh , it's a little bit\nIt's not really that responsive , no .\nYou have to hold it , right ?\nMm .\nHmm .\nIt's a beautiful animal .\nOh , you have to p press it pretty hard . With a smile on it ,\nIt's a cute elephant .\nit's very important . Yeah .\nAnd uh not to forget its tail . Oh .\nIt's a nice beard .\nYeah , it's okay . Yes .\nAnd you was making comments on my dolphin .\nI will beat the dolphin .  No .\nOkay , so it's just a bee .\nYeah .\nSo I suggest you make us the elephant in the market . The big and strong player in the market . This would be good .\nYeah . Yeah .\nOkay , excellent . On to the next one .\nOkay .\nUh yeah .\nOkay , you should press next .\nYeah .\nPress next . Yeah , it's up there .\nOkay .\nThat's it .\nOkay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger .\nYou picked a hard one , didn't you ?\nMy drawing skills are really bad , so .\nExperience with the tiger .\nWhat ? They are\nThey are really bad , my drawing skills .\nOkay uh-huh .\nSure looks smooth .\nOh .\nI'm not sure how the legs should go , but\nUh these are stripes .\nGot it .\nI've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources .\nWhat does it want ?\nUh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible .\nOkay .\nAnd it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything ,\nMm .\nsecurity , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use .\nI agree .\nOkay .\n, I'm supposed to draw the animal next . Yay I introduce to the world the amazing ant .\nUh hard worker .\nGreat team-workers .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nDo everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong . So I'm gonna give it a smiley face .\nOh .\nYeah , yeah .\nNot sure where the p  . Just put 'em here . Whatever .\nThink it need shoes . So\nI'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so   That's the coolest ant ever .\nYou've done this before , haven't you ?\nI love to draw ants . It's my hobby .\nAnyway  Nah .  Just  I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you take  just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .\nYeah .\nJust  Yeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway .  another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now . Uh put this down . Examples . Well I guess we have a little little time extra , but  Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work .

Do  uh  Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ?

Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all .\nBut\nUh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with .\nYeah .\nNo rational changes or whatever , 'cause it  revolutionary changes ,\nOkay , so very intuitive design , I guess .\nyes .  Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add ,\nand perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?\nYeah , we want  I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So  I think  I mean , really disabled people , yeah ,  might be a problem , but I think it's a little  take it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short .

So let's see the  what did you prepare .\nYeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ? Mm the shared folder .\nSh share folder for th your presentation ?\nYes . We have a presentation .\nBecause I have here\nUh   So I got the participant uh three . W uh  . Three . It's the final design , yeah .\nOkay just one  .\nS so so I discussed with Guillaume .\nMm .  Yeah .\nRight .  And uh  so we have   and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or  control module . And detachable big buttons for all people um . So  .\nS okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes  . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button .\nMm .\nYou can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function .\nMm . Mm-hmm .\nYou have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the  for the speech recognition system here .\nAnd here the the switch that control if you want\nWhy you why you you put it in the the side ?\nWell I I I think uh it's the\nIt's not a good place maybe  .\nYeah but\nNo i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere .\nYeah .\nIs it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?\nWell so it's a microphone array .\nOh it's very costly , microphone array  .\nMm-hmm .\nNo\nYeah\nit's just a single microphone , and you  I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to\nMm .\nYeah .\nwell it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance .\nYeah  yeah .\nOkay .\nAnd here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .\nHow much does it cost this one ?\nWell this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars\nFor the\nFifteen dollars ?\nYeah .\nfifteen dollars ,\nAh it's above it's above the budget .\nbut uh well it's not it's not uh  yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh  voila .\nThe cost would be le reduced .\nYeah the  and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .\nMm . Hmm .\nHow many b battery is there ?\nHow many , excuse me ?\nBattery .\nWell uh f battery , we use uh about uh\nIs it n the two A_A_s batteries in it .\nYeah .\nA_A_ rechargeable batteries .\nRechargeable of course ,\nYeah rechargeable batteries .\nbecause we have the charger .\nWe have the charger so it's no problem .\nYeah and you just\nSo one one battery ?\nOn uh yeah one battery .\nIs that two or one ?\nIt's kinetic reserve .\nActually uh it's a flexible thing .\nYou just n uh\nNow what is the whole day rating for that ?\nThe  excuse me ?\nWhole day's rating .\nWhat type of battery ?\nOh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh\nYeah yeah .\nif you uh like it's exist .\nSomething like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ?\nYeah .\nYeah  .\nMm-hmm .\nSo and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger\nYeah . Yeah .\nand uh leave it uh alone , it's alright .\nMm .  At uh  yeah .\nThen the next time you pick it , oh\nit works  .\nI forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button\nYeah just explain the button uh Norman .\nyeah alright . This button is like the mouse  is like a joystick ,\nyou can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it  the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button  .\nMm .\nYou can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement  .\nAnd the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ?\nYeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ .\nYep .\nYeah .\nHere I present another version without the L_C_D_ .\nI think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is  getting destroyed .\nMm .\nIf you\nUh okay this is new prototype uh  .\nYeah it's\nSo we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also  .\nYeah yeah .\nSo basically th it's the same uh\nUh-huh and also the switch .\nyeah  .\nOkay .\nBasically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button .\nMm .\nSo um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars .\nNo four dollars , it's   good .\nAnd I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger ,\nOh no\nbecause that's a major that's a\nth actually th we'll come to that point in our\nYeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system .\nYeah .\nOkay\nSo\nand if you disable speech recognition system then ?\nW w I'll I'll come to that point later on .\nso Norman will explain to you  .\nMm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm .\nAnd we will we will serve the charger with this ?\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah yeah of course mm  .\nTh they  either these with the  uh the the charger any\nWith the remote control .\nin either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .\nOkay so the price of the charger included in the\nUh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh  .\nThank thank you  .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd so mm-hmm .\nIt's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but\nThe price should be below twelve and a half Euro .\nYeah . Yeah\nWell that's  so\nbut as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to  people are willing to pay more for good design .\nWe have we have just\nYeah people are willing to pay more ,\nbut the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .\nThe price of selling is twenty five Euros .\nYeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm .\nAnd the price of production\nAlright please uh go on Norman with the special features  .\nOr uh\nYeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system ,\nso is uh modular .\nThat's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .\nYeah yeah ,\nfor example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it  put it back in , or you can use the other one ,\nSomething like customised . Yeah\nYeah .\nor  the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah .\nYou want a microphone to put in the  speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see  .\nOkay .\nMm hmm hmm hmm .\nSo\nHmm okay .\nIt's pretty flexible in the yeah price  .\nYou also have the the the two other modules for the parental control\nBut\nUh yeah yeah you should present that .\nthat that you ca you can add up  to the  to your remote control\nAnd this is other one ?\ni i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .\nYeah .\nH here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up  they come up with their modules ,\nMm hmm hmm hmm .\nthey just plug in it\nYeah\nand they can have all the control they want here .\nMm .\nWe also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled ,\nHmm .\nand it acts like the previous one ,\nYeah .\nyou just plug in and it works .\nYeah\nMm-hmm .\nthe i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with  the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here  .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here  oop\nit's very robust  , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ?\nThe titanium\nTitanium .\nand so it's very uh\nAgain uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want .\nYeah that's fine .\nLithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_  and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the  or is it\nOkay .\nthat's the reminder part . Yeah and um  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define\nMm hmm hmm hmm .\nso  sorry ?\nAnd then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a  of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And  and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from  yeah  .\nAnd also like the  and the fancy designs yeah .\nWhat what's\nMaybe we can improve more on the design but\nMaybe yeah .\nWhat's the price to p to produce ?\nuh this is the\nWell so the price to produce  For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .\nWith with with the charge ?\nUh it's about it  The  without without the charger\nWith the charger ?\nOkay .\nYeah\nit's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .\nTwo dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_  , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .\nYeah .\nWe don't have charger .\nI think we can use Excel  .\nIt's about\nWe don't have all the options  .\nso the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .\nCharger we don't have charger here either .\nYeah .\nNo it's\nBut it's just if you want all functionalities .\nit's below the the the budget .\nYeah  .\nExcuse me ?\nIt's below the bu the budget .\nYeah it's a nice input\nWe\nbut we have an other inputs from the l public demands .\nI think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu\nYeah .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "prototypes, prototype, presentation, remote, controls", "dialogue_id": 69}, {"text": "I think we can just go to my presentation then . We can wind up . Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions .\nSo the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is  first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold .\nMm .\nAnd the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .\nOf course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use .\nMm .\nWell I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .\nOkay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find  these are the latest fashion updates , and so this  in Paris and Milan  they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .\nSpongy spongy . Mm mm .\nSo I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes .\nMm  mm .\nAnd the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .\nBut the the problem is that uh   is it robust to mishandling ?\nOkay .\nWe have  you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy  .\nA sponge .\nYeah so uh  so finally we have these three criterias .\nSpongy  .\nOne is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use .\nSo these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote .\nMm-hmm .\nSo  and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these ,\nHmm .\nsay that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven ,\nMm-hmm .\nand for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .\nMm .\nSo now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ,\nMm .\nso on this scale , if it is true , if it is  if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't  it looks uh  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So\nSo\nWe can make our study on this and\nso is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ?\nNo no we have  you have designed two products now ,\nYeah .\none is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nBut who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?\nYou .\nAccording to you , no according to you designers , how will feel  does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ?\nMm .\nOkay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look  how does it look ?\nMm . Mm .\nD is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?\nWell it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four .\nAnd you both agree for that ?\nAnd you ?\nI think we can improve on the design .\nSom someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh   design .\nYeah . It's it it\nUm we have been focused all all this  time on the  on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity .\nTechnical aspects .\nMm-hmm .\nAs for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help  .\nSo I take three on  with L_C_D_ ?\nYeah a three .\nSo without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?\nYeah  .\nUh four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated\nFour .\nso removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .\nYeah .  Yeah .\nAnd in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .\nWell it's it's the same for both so  I will give a five , six .\nMm .\nFive with L_C_D_ and\nWell five also uh  Norman please .\nYeah\nUh\nfrom the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um  the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now  and another innovation we have is simplicity and  simplicity , few buttons , we've uh   A lot of functionalities .\nWith lot of functionalities .\nSo that is uh that is uh for both th\nSo without L_C_D_ ?\nOur gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all  well this is a biased judgement\nbecause we designed them .\nNo no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?\nYeah .  Uh the innovation is v is very high I think .\nFor L_C_D_ .\nWith L_C_D_ .\nBoth .\nAnd without L_C_D_ ?\nMm for both it's the the same innovations .\nFor both . It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven .\nOkay .\nsix , let's go for six .\nWithout L_C_D_ .\nBoth .\nNo actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I  there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y\nYeah .\nthen when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness .\nMm .\nUh no innovative yeah .\nUh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?\nSo we can't go\nTalk about\nWe haven't really uh determined  what are  actually actually\nI mean that what you are sayin that's what the design\nit's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ?\nNo it's like this ,\nI mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme .\nSo let's remove it .\nYeah ? Yeah . Yeah but\nYeah\nBut\nbut you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .\nUh then\nYes exactly .\nThis is the problem .\nNo on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .\nIf you have the L_C_D_ , but if n\nL_C_D_ ? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ .\nYeah .\nOr then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a\nBut you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .\nI mean that depends upon your design , so\nAnyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_  we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ ,\nI mean\nwe give what the customer uh wants , right .\nYeah .\nSo without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which  do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ?\nWell I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons ,\nYeah\nand uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so\nYeah . Yeah .\nWell with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product\nso I will give a six for the easy to use .\nYeah I think\nNo it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .\nsorry .\nBecause that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price ,\nYeah .\nand I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be\nYeah .\nOr we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes\nYeah .  Yeah .\naccording to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch\nYeah .\nwithout L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good .\nYeah , it's cheaper to produce .\nYeah .\nMm .  S\nAnd uh if the the  well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so\nYeah that's right .\nYeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people .\nMm-hmm .\nFor the young generation easy to use may be very complicated\nYep .\nbecause uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the  s similarit for the old people they want simplicity ,\nYeah yeah that's right .\nso that's why  we have the parental module . Uh we can ha have  build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . User customisation is very important yeah . Yeah\nYeah .\nso\nSix .\nSo without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?\nMm-hmm .\nW uh\nOr you want it to be six ?\nI think it's the same .\nUm six .\nYeah .\nYes as you say , with better uh\nWithout L_C_D_ .\nS s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .\nyeah . And to improve the the look .\nAs our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm .\nand it's going to be much simpler to use .\nYes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so\nYeah .\nso let's go back to our laboratory and\nTo improve on the design .\nWhat a what what about the sys speech recognition ?\nSo .\nwhat about the integration of speech recognition ?\nHuh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . Right ?\nYeah .\nThat's going to be an optional .\nYeah .\nIf somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .\nAh so it's optional with the  okay .\nIt's an optional .\nIt's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more  likes more to have a spongy uh  remote control than\nI think it will be  I think i\nYeah .\nI think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh\nYeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module\nYeah . Or ma yeah .\nand so that their parents can't use it  .\nOr maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or ,\nso mayb better if you have all this in the same\nIn the same set , yeah ,\nand and individual buttons to make them work .\nYeah .\nThe problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children   when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . So we might lose the customer because of this . I don't know ,\nSo you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  uh will be optional .\nwhat do you think uh ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag  .\nUh\nI mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple  or how many couples have a T_V_\nYeah .\nor to the number or singles who have a television .\nYeah .\nSo based on that I think\nYeah .  But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ?\nI think it inc increase .\nWell you can   if you had uh something li\nI think it i increases .\nOh no ,\nbecause if you if you add uh something  well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but\nHmm .\nBut you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options .\nYeah yeah yeah\nit's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the  functionalities um on the same module , but uh\nMm .  Mm . Yeah .\nOn the same P_C_B_\nWell well the other aspect is that if  in the  when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the  you're gonna keep the same customer ,\nYeah .\nyeah yeah .\nbecause the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .\nYeah that's right .\nSo so\nI mean you could just provide with an optional  .\nYeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again .\nSo it's something like a Microsoft product  update .\nAnd and we we we we we we don't want that .\nWe're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m\nUpdates and we sell it . We make updates and sell it  .\nYeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be  can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ?\nYeah .\nYeah , it depends on the v production .\nAnd uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ?\nWell so\nUh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?\nYeah yeah\nDo you require different types of P_C_B_s and\nI think we are   yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um  but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so\nMm .\nOr uh it could be like this  the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all .\nMm .\nUh well but it's a bit complicated to  if if if you need machines to  different machines to um ah well\nYeah . What we can change is to propose the  customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin\nYeah , yeah that's right .\nand then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better .\nYeah yeah we can have the same global shape\nYeah .\nand then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .\nYeah .\nYeah that's right .\nYeah .  Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh ?\nSponge .\nI think you need to look into the material .\nYeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing  .\nYeah yeah .\nOkay .\nSo", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "innovations, innovation, innovative, innovativeness, presentation", "dialogue_id": 69}, {"text": "So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say .\nI think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .\nProject evaluation project satisfaction , for example .

Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um  uh I had an email from the from the management board\nuh , I don't know if you a al also uh received it , but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important .

Uh second one is also important uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , so uh that's one thing to keep in mind .\nUh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh  would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty .

I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhich I will show you .  The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . Um  one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . Um , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . Um , we have three audiences of  two audiences ,  I'm sorry . Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five  age . Uh the second one is from sixty four  uh forty six to sixty five . Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent  um sixty five . Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . Mm  and some interests from the from the age groups , uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . I don't think that's uh really appropriate . Um ,  and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh  Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . Second findings  out of the questionnaire um are the opinion  the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer . Okay , third findings . According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um  following buttons are most important . Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . Um ,  persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour ,\nMm-hmm .\nand uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . Um , when you multiply them , you get the  these three points . Switching channels , um yeah , that's pretty uh pretty normal , that's what you do with a remote control . Um the second , teletext , uh and the third , uh volume controls . Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want  wants , uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear .\nBut it's strange that the the manage board  the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . So that that's strange .\nYeah , okay . Yeah , okay , but uh at the moment uh teletext is  Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information .\nYeah , okay . Yeah .\nSo uh , when you ask people , what do they use ,  they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control .\nOkay . Yeah , okay .\nThat's ridiculous .\nYeah .\nThat's a ne i it  It's a new technology ,\nYeah .\nbut it's not incorporated right now . Okay , my personal preferences . Um , I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five .  Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . Um , yeah , people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . Um  second point ,  we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . Third point um that came out of the uh  of the questionnaire , uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_\nYeah , that's a cool idea .\nwhere you can put the the remote control in .  Um , that's about it , I think . Yeah .\nWhen you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about ?\nUh not not the r not the functions ,\nUh , the funtionability .\nbut uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , yeah it's\nYeah .\nAh okay , so focusing more on the used buttons .\nYeah , they have to be on it\nYeah .\nj just to t to get it done if necessary ,\nbut um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or\nCould you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example .\nYeah , perhaps .\nThank you .\nJust for the minor functions perhaps .\nYeah , ma perhaps , just just an idea .\nJust to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .\nYeah .\nYeah ?

Janus , can you uh", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "audiences, audience, questionnaire, respondents, usability", "dialogue_id": 70}, {"text": "Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure . Right uh , I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . Um right . Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh  a cheap uh remote . Well uh as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth  Well it may be possible , but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in  within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . F because uh  well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth  or or radio waves ,  although\nWhat do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ?\nYeah , actually I have t\nSo it's in the wrong product .\nYeah . Yeah , I actually  I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh  the infrared function . So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nbut uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something ,\nYeah .\nI dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost  that something like that would be . But it may be uh may be something to explore . Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . Uh first you have the energy source . The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use  you could just go out and buy a new one . So we didn't  and we don't have to do all uh  to be too complicated about that . Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch  there is a switch uh between these . When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh  immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_ , so is is something wrong or something . So that's just to uh to to explain the  of  to to uh make it clearer to the user . Uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . Uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said uh  well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use  you don't use them , so why why should we invent uh  w spend more time on those . Uh I I think we should stick by  with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . So uh no input from the television . So I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such . So I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and\nUm , yeah , maybe another problem uh , I think current T_V_s can even send infrared .\nYes , but what should we uh s I I I f I agree with you , but should we spend money or  and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ?\nHuh .\n'Cause that would be  I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nThese all uh all stuff that we have to take in account .\nYeah .\nSo I I  my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . Um , well\nYeah .\nwe should uh look into the design and the functionability . Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh  stuff . And uh don't overbuild , we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics . So that was my uh my personal opinion . And that was my uh my presentation uh\nOkay , thank you Janus .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remote, controls, infrared, bluetooth, presentation", "dialogue_id": 70}, {"text": "Okay . Yes ,\nYou do ?\nI can go ahead .\nThe last presentation . You have plenty of time ,\nLast presentation . Okay .\nTim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes ,\nso uh take your time .\nIf you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh\nwarn you .\nWell , I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions .\nUm what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh  if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , so tha that's that's some of the main points . And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time ,\nHmm .\n'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure .\nAnd uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible ,\nHmm .\nsince we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that . Um well , of course I I hope this is all clear to you . If you  you can use remote like this with all the functions ,  many functions , but  Well , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . You have to be very careful what you push ,\nand um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um  yeah well , where is it ? Where the hell  he here I guess and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else . So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . For example if you want to use a play and back and stop , that's very important . Um well this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but um it's no longer uh applying .  Well yeah , I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and um n uh not to give too many options and and if possible , uh the buttons should give  a dr direct action , not first select\nUh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , so uh\nYeah ,\nyou you want to keep it simple ,\nand so that's where the difficulties lie .\nYeah , but\nbut I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one .\nYeah , this  so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other .\nYeah . Yeah , but\nDo we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought ,\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nor do we want to use um many buttons .\nYeah .\nSo um weighing those factors .\nHmm  it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_  or a touch screen um , that in the middle are the the main keys , like displayed on the\nUh yeah .\nThe  doesn't  .\n. Yeah , this ? No ? Yeah .  Something like that . Okay , just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching ,\nYeah .\nand then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or  that you can drop down .\nYeah , but when all the questions I had  Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ? Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay .\nMm .\nUh so that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle  button , um display the menu on the T_V_\nNah . Mm-hmm .\nand don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds ,\nYeah .\nis too complicated for most users .\nYeah .\nYeah , but\nI think so too , but   and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ .\nYeah , that will be a problem .\nWell\nYeah .\nyou d you have to  keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not  our remote won't be able to work on all televisions .\nYes .\nAnd that would be uh a considerable problem .\nSo if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this .\nYeah .\nUse big clear buttons . Not too many . So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , but I think i this is more important . Um  especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen .\nNot embed Yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could  could make more menu up  pop up or something .\nAnd yeah , if you want to uh uh s put  on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . Not first change menu options or switch something .\nYeah .\nUm , well yeah , as you already told , give some feedback . If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .\nYeah .\nAnd um , well , my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , keep it simple . So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function  on the the television , some you you'll never know uh and never use , and therefore it's uh important", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "presentation, remotes, usability, remote, design", "dialogue_id": 70}, {"text": "Yeah .\nif you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important  um well you  we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions .\nYeah . Uh , I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , um and that's a big ad advantage I think , because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something .\nMm-hmm .\nIt's uh very visual intended .  What was I to say more ?\nMaybe that's an option . Um keep the primary buttons visible . Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands\nYeah .\nand for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form .\nBut uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear\nand maybe use a touch screen , or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um\nYeah okay , but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea\nYeah .\nthen what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?\nThe extra functions .\nThe extra functions , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,\nYeah , but l like menu functions or\nYeah .\nand then all all the options will become available\nAh okay .\nand you just c s yeah t scroll through them .\nWouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet\nYeah , I think so .\nand uh I'll just make um  uh let's say fifteen buttons on it , and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with  or sub-items , sub-functions .\nWell um\nYeah .\nthen I'd like to make a proposal .\nIf you make one big touch screen ,\nYes .\nuse the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .\nYeah , yeah ,\nYeah .\nlike like the iPod idea that that we just saw .\nYeah .\nYou just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several  you can also improve uh later on .\nYes .\nUh uh I think that will be great .\nOkay .\nSo you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .\nYeah , I think so .\nYeah , I wou I would actually go for the\nJirun ?\nOkay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen .\nYeah .\nYeah , of course .\nAnd so um an elder designer picks up th the  of\nYeah .\nan elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .\nYeah yeah yeah . Yeah .\nYeah , I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike building in uh some kind of PIN code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh\nYeah .\nbut children uh  if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or\nYeah wh Is that possible to use or no ?\nThat is possible , that  well that actually depends on the television ,\nTh there's just\nWell , yeah well ,\nbut I think  I figure that would be\ndoes it have to depend on the television ?\nJu just a simple log-in , something like that .\nWell ,\nYeah .\ny you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , the the channels are different on each te television ,\nYeah .\nthey aren't set in a preset order ,\nYeah .\nso uh if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television ,\nMm-hmm . Yeah , okay .\nso that would be uh that would be actually the main concern .\nYeah . Yeah .\nWell , I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh  make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match , and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh  change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume\nYeah .\nand uh\nYeah , th that kind of stuff , but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels\nMm-hmm .\nYes .\nand like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , that's uh vi violent channel ,\nOh , something like that .\nYes .\nuh m my ki my kids uh  I don't want my kids to watch that ,\nYeah .\nthen you set the priority to only parents ,\nOkay , yeah .\nYeah .\nWell b but make it a separate option in the menu ,\nYeah , that would b\nfor example . But\nYeah , that .\nso that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh  displayed here ,\nYeah okay , but but  yeah , that's just\nso uh parents uh\nthat's an a an added feature .\nYeah . Okay . But let's not uh go too wide about the  those things , that's that why we're here .\nYeah ,  th th those things are nice .\nIt's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel  later in the stage . I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p\nPartial .\nyeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals\nYeah .\nuh and uh  the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible .\nYeah , but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers\nYeah , you can de display it on the on the old style .\nthat's just as e just as easy .\nUh . I I do\nYou can display actual buttons on the touch screens .\nYeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true .\nUh I do agree ,\nYeah .\nbecause well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen\nYeah , okay .\nor when you touch a button , but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience .\nYeah , it's different .\nYeah .\nW we are aiming for younger people\nYeah , that's true , yeah .\nand they they chose\nYeah , age b below forty .\nYeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . Yep .\nSo that's that's probably uh a\nAnd th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff ,\nMm-hmm . They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true .\nso  A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications .\nMm-hmm .\nI th I think we can do that too .\nMm  Yeah . Okay , as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh  are done .\nDone .\nUh I've uh added the  this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind .\nMm-hmm .\nUm each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . Uh so that can be uh can be read out . Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um  Moment . Ooh . Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh  we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't  uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh  um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically  each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the  done by the remote control and not by the television . I think that's the point what uh\nMm-hmm .\nwe discussed .\nYes .\nYeah , yeah , some of them . The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ .\nWell you can use um  when you   uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T_V_ ,\nYeah , but that's not possible .\nthen there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume\nMm-hmm , mm yeah .\nand um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from  ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable  the  capable from the t\nYeah , but you have uh uh an\nAdd th that that's an opportunity  .\nyeah , but you have an international market range , so you have I think a big range of\nWell there are universal d um um remotes\nYeah .\nand they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nBut they\nBut\nAnd it's not too complex to do it .\nWell they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_\nNo .\nYeah .\nand that that is bit of a tricky job .\nYeah .\nI actually use one of those when  They are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive ,\nYeah . Well  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh um mo\nand that's well\nNo no no .\nno , you can just say uh the c\nHe he he he me he means just just one other thing .\nJust build it in .\nYeah .\nUh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press  yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ .\nYeah . Yes .\nIn codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . You look up , I have a Philips H_ fifty five\nYeah .\nand it says press code four five five\nYeah .\nOh , okay , yeah , sure , uh\nand you press code four five five on the  uh in the remote\nYeah yeah yeah .\nand it displays all your uh menu options .\nOh , yeah yeah , sure , that would be possible , yeah .\nYeah . Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options , in  just just in the memory ,\nMemory in the in the remote .\nYep .\nProfiles .\nso that if you  yeah , like profile , so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh\nYeah .\nthe memory uh pops up the options .\nYeah . Yeah , that would be possible . Yeah , sure .\nOkay .\nI th don't think that's uh  that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .\nNo , that wouldn't be uh\nYeah , well um\nYeah , a few variables .\nif you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nso uh I think uh it is possible  .\nAh it is . It is definitely po\nBut , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote\nWe have five minutes to go .\nYeah . Well then you have to buy a new one , it's very good for marketing\nNew remote ?\nMaybe , or an update , software update .\nA firmware upgrade or something ,\nFirmware update , you say .\nYeah , firmware upgrade .\nbut from where ? Ah . Maybe w\nThat's maybe the cup holder .\nNo m may no ,\nYeah .\nmaybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet .\nWell , not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home . Well the most most people have ,\nWell , at\nbut not not everybody\nuh you can go back to the shop\nand\nand uh they\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nlike a s kind of service centre .\nYeah , ser o\nYeah , maybe something like service cen\nYeah .\nand they can download it for you .\nOr you could  well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier ,\nMm-hmm .\nand you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection .\nYeah . Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards , T_V_ uh connections ,\nYeah .\nyou can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , so maybe j they  we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh\nWell then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh  well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in ,\nReceiving . Oh yeah .\nYeah .\nwe could actually look at  into it ,\nYeah .\nbut  I dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs  uh with with it\nDifficult . Yeah .\nand\nI I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop .\nYeah yeah , uh s I think some  I think it's good idea , yeah .\nYeah , that would be probably best , yeah .\nYeah .\nLike when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask  well I'll\nIt's it's it's not a lot of work , just one uh docking station where you put it in ,\nYeah .\npress start , bling bling , updated .\nYeah , that would be best , yeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .  You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so .\nOkay , let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh\nNo no . Exactly , so\nUm m for which one are we going ?  My mistake .\nLet's vote .\nThat one or uh\nYeah , my vote goes out to the right  .\nYour vote and your\nMy vote too .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nAnd your vote ?\nWell , I was uh doubting about which one to take , but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open .\nOpens up is too difficult\nFlips open .\nor uh\nUh too difficult , um maybe uh it's easier to break it .\nN yeah .\nBreak it , I don't get\nYeah , th th th that i uh   Yeah .\nIt's very sensitive .\nOh so  Yeah .\nLike my telephone , it's uh it's sensitive too .\nYeah .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 4, "keywords": "remotes, buttons, remote, controls, touch", "dialogue_id": 70}, {"text": "Okay well uh it's almost at the end .

And we uh decided on\nYep .\ndecided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five ,\nMm-hmm .\nand we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um  . And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . Um so that was the last meeting .\nMm-hmm .\nIs there anything  have I forgotten anything ?\nNo .\nIs that everything ?\nUh that sounds  .\nOkay . Um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of  that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . That might be a better idea this time .\nSure .\nAnd so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David ,\nOkay .\nif that's alright .\nSure .\nYep .\nUm and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right  .\nYeah , cool .\nSo if you wanna take this .\nWhy don't I get that  ? Hmm .\nScrewed in quite tightly . Uh what did  uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? We  did we say we were gonna try  maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ?\nMm-hmm .\nRight . Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .\nOkay .\nSo um  that's kind of the end result hopefully .\nOkay . Um alright so c is it function F_ eight ?\nUh-huh . Hopefully appear in a wee second .\nHmm . Come on . I think it's working .\nUp there we go .\nOkay great s so let me just start this .  Okay great . So um  uh s move on . Uh-huh  oh where'd it all go ?\nOh no .\nIt's not good . Okay lemme just see where I can find it . This looks more like it . I think I just opened up the template .\nOh right .\nSorry about that . Okay alright so let's have a look here .\nHere we go .\nOkay so this was the method that um I've taken . Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .\nOkay .\nAnd uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see  sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ?\nYep .\nMm-hmm .\nI thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this .\nAye a fair point definitely .\nOkay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .\nOkay .\nUm however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Number two was that it be innovative . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um  quite user friendly while still having technology . So it  I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um  what we should think about is how the um  about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .\nAye right .\nFor example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative\nUh-huh .\nbecause obviously the thing that  the message here is ease of use . So how do you make innovation make something more  more easy to use ? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this .\nOkay .\nOkay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . Uh top European fashion trend um  that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay ,\nespecially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it ,\nOkay okay .\ndo you know what I mean ? So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um  so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something ,\nI think that would be pushing it .\nAnd then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is  which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . Um  So these this is the summary of everything . Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen  it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . That was like the number three thing . And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods ,\nMm-hmm .\nsomething which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons .\nMm that's true , yeah .\nYou know what a Mac iPod is ? I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of  or more of like a   maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um  techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . Sort of like a  I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . Um  Does that make sense ? Yeah . So  so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their  what people associate this  them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .\nMm 'kay . Great .\nLike um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and\nOkay .\nSo anyway it's just just an idea .\nYeah .\nI'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um   into something which is  which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up .\nAh .\nHow can we build on that ? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so .\nOkay .\nAnyway those are  that's all I have ,\nThat's great .\nbut uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into\nUh-huh . Okay great .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, talking, plan, teletext, functionality", "dialogue_id": 71}, {"text": "Um thank you for that . Uh Craig do you wanna\nYep .\nuh plug yours in then ?\nIs it working ?\nMm . Not quite .\nDid you press F_ eight ?\nIt's probably not sending . Yeah .\nOh something coming now , yeah .\nYep , there it is .\nThere we go .\nAnd so think of this concept . Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um  So then this  we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .\nMm .\nUm what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . Um they're not very attractive to look at ,  and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're  I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . Um they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , uh it really should be . It's uh something the user then uh identify with . This is a red switch off , that's how it should be . Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control  um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that  um   The buttons should be large . They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . They should be easy to press , very comfortable .  Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um  there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them ,\nMm-hmm .\nso the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . Um should avoid s things like that . Um  if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .\nOkay .\nUm obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea .\nYeah . Okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ?\nI think it's yellow\nI didn't know .\nbecause like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow ,\nOkay .\nAnd the Play-Doh 's yellow  .\nso yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there ,\nOkay .\nFantastic .\nbut keep going\nOkay .\nand we'll discuss it after .\nUm\nYeah .\nany extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the   um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort .\nMm-hmm .\nUm if we did decide to go for voice activation  there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or  Um  we should definitely avoid the big square block look . That's just wrong .\nMm 'kay .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department ,  and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question .\nMm .\nSo it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take\nAye that's a good idea , yeah .\nand  possibility . Right and these are problems I've had with it . Um I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . I think it's um , fashion into electronics .\nYeah .\nAnd we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or\nMm .\nOkay .\nMm .\nCool .\nThat's it .\nOkay .\nGreat .  Lots of good information there .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah that that was very good ,\nMm 'kay um .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "controls, buttons, button, control, remote", "dialogue_id": 71}, {"text": "and uh now with David .\nI think I'm cool .\nIt's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle   of the table ,\nI know it'd be handy , wouldn't it .\nhuh ? Just um\nOops .\nDo y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um\nYeah okay . Let me just get this going first .\nYeah .\nAh there it is .\nIt takes a second , doesn't it ?\n'Kay , that should be it . Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic .\nSo just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it\nMm-hmm .\nand we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . Um the components are exactly the same .\nMm-hmm .\nUm I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . And the power is basically a factor of that . Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said  we've defined , like we only want the basic things that  to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . So um you know it's just a matter of working out space .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . So just go through it in the components . Um these are the options that are available to you , um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .\nRight .\nUm it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that .\nMm .\nSo maybe if you\nHmm .\nwell I could see the other email that they sent you , um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements  , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons ,\nRight .\nokay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel ,\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nokay there's an L_C_D_ display ,\num I think these are quite standard things .\nThey're standard , aren't they ?\nNo um they're  well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .\nYeah .\nOkay um then there's um how the case actually looks . It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , um but um\nMm-hmm .\nI could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination .\nWe  you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ?\nUm I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't  I'm not very sure about the titanium .\nYeah .\nThey had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .\nHmm .\nUm the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use ,\nMm 'kay .\nbut the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing ,\nOkay .\nso I think that there is some restriction on um  I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nYou know as opposed to two .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost . Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nPower consumption should be about the same . Um I think the main impact is complexity ,\nHmm .\num and the other thing is um the power options . Um the first one is a standard battery . Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up  you know , a crank  .\nI'll clear one of these things for you . Just by moving it yeah .\nHmm .\nYeah but that that might be something   I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing .\nMm .\nNo .\nOkay the other ones are a solar powered cell ,\nYeah .\nwhich may not be a great idea in Europe or  any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead .\nSo like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one\nMm-hmm .\nbecause it's movement and people like to fiddle with their  and it's a nice sales gimmick I think .\nMm .\nFrom a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing ,\nMm-hmm .\nit's a shake it  it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . You know\nW yeah .\nyou know\nHmm .\nyou have  you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes ,\nUh yeah yeah , I see .\nYeah .\nyou know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber .\nHmm .\nYou know just to  if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it ,\nYeah .\nkind of  you know just uh you know um  so . Um okay\nI know what you mean yeah .\nHmm .\nmy  from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think um something comfortable to hold , um small and slim\nMm-hmm .\nI guess that's more in the sense of  small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it  um so .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nUm okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic .  Um the case  okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels .\nMm .\nOkay with the titanium case , let me just check that um ,\ntitanium case can't be curved , it has to be square .\nOkay .\nOkay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and\nIt can't be curved .\nit can't be curved on the wood .\nOkay .\nSo that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , um especially the titanium\nOkay .\nI I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need .\nRight .\nSo um  mixing them may not be a good idea um yep . That's it .\nOkay . Right can I\nUh question on  can I ask a question ?\nYeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so  but yeah you c ask away .\nOkay . Can we uh power a light in this ? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ?\nUm I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light\nMm .\nOkay .\nso that\nSo maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery .\nWhy what kind of light do you want  are you thinking of ?\nWell  I mean I'm thinking it might be  That  for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it\nUh-huh . Yeah .\nand that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ?\nAre you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive .\nIlluminate the buttons . Yeah it glows . Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this ,\nOkay .\nand that's what everybody does . Oh where's the volume button in the dark ,\nOkay .\nYeah yeah yeah .\nand uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something .\nLike a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone .\nOkay .\nLike a phone , yeah yeah .\nOkay cool .\nWhereas with phones , people charge them once a week .\nYeah .\nWe're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days .\nUm that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch\nMm .\nBut are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ?\num it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it .\nRight .\nSo you could trigger that to a light ,\nMm .\nSure .\nlike I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light\nOkay .\nas opposed to\nOkay .\nso when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the\nRight .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nRight\nglowingness .\nokay um well\nOkay , great .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "components, cable, designing, complexity, component", "dialogue_id": 71}, {"text": "let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an  decision on the the the concepts of the product .\nOkay .  Okay .\nSo back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that .\nYeah .\nUm I mean what does everybody think about\nYeah .\nDoes anybody have any ideas of  about how we can fit all that in together ? I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ?\nUm  I think we could go for like um   maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit .\nSo maybe  do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or\nUm probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand .\nSo something quite curvy ? Okay um right okay . Colour-wise I mean you made a re uh was it you or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , was that\nI think he made that .\nWhose\nWhat's that ?\nabout how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much .\nYeah .\nUm and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know . Um\nOkay .\nAnd then obviously the uh the materials  when it  has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? That's all .\nWell I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts ,\nMm-hmm .\nand if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um  the look and feel .\nMm-hmm .\nSo for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the  on the um  the colour ,\nMm-hmm .\nyou said company colour yellow . I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhat  can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the\nOkay .\nshapes and things .\nRight .\nIs there a particular shape that you're interested in ? Like does marketing have any research on  does it need to be long ?\nDoes it need  with a square thing wha\nOh you know like in circular in shape or\nYeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of\nYeah .\nChoice of material yeah .\nLike fruit .  I'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky .\n'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well  you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones ,\nSee I'm\nand they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels  it feels kind of warmer to the touch . It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . And then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um   Well I'm  do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or\nNo no no not at all .\nno I don't think we do either  .\nIt's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with .\nOkay right well um\nDo you know what I mean ?\nso thoughts about the actual shape of the thing .\nI'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape .\nA snowman shape ?\nUm so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need .\nUh-huh . That's quite a distinctive shape ,\nRight ,\nthat would be good\nsure .\nwouldn't it . Yeah\nYeah .\nso yeah should we go with that ?\nUm can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a\nDo you wanna draw it on the board ?\nCan you like  yeah just t we can visualize it .\nUm something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside\nOoh that'd be good .\nor uh you have volume controls about there .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay . Yep .\nSo call it the snowman-shape trademark  . Yeah that's cool . Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white  do you want something\nMm .\nSo I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this  here , had a sorta background yellow ,\nUh-huh .\nand then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons .\nOkay cool . Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . Or when you like  or if you turn it off or something  if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere .\nI think that might scare me .\nI d I d any thoughts on that at all ?\nI think that'd probably scare me . You turn it on your control possessed s  .\nI know . Um unless an a I mean if you  also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? Would we put that on the inside or\nDo we need an L_C_D_ display ?\nUm\nWhat what's the functionality of that ?\nIt's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought .\nYeah but the question is what are we using it\nWhat would it achieve ?\nwhat would we what would we achieve from it ? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a\nWell  L_C_ well I'd  when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings .\nYeah .\nSo as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is .\nMm-hmm . I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it ,\nRight , okay .\nso um it's a bit nuts to get the  Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know .\nMm oh yeah that's true . Yeah . So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ?\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nUm I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , but um it's  what's what what would it tell the user ,\nI think that would make it very complex .\n'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm not real\nWe have the option of the speaker as well  the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ?\nI don't know if there is really ,\nMm-hmm .\nNah .\nno um\nUm\nI would say no need for a talk-back . Uh does anybody disagree with that ?\nYou could put a game on it  .\nNo ?\nNo .\nEasy  .\nWhen the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control  .\nOkay um right\nMm mm .\nso you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ?\nUm  well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside .\nOkay .\nB um I think the  we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere .\nOkay right um what else do you need to talk about ?\nWell i I was just\nWhere would you physically position the buttons ? Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things .\nYeah  .\nUm maybe you wanna draw onto the\nUm\nYeah .\nSo I'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about .\nYep .\nOh sh God we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go . Um energy what  do you think that's suggesting we're  how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power ,\nYeah , sure .\nI mean what does anybody think about that ?\nUm I've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it ,\nNo , like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just\nand watches yeah  Sure , okay , right , okay .\nOkay .\nSupport for it .\nYeah .\nI mean just  it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time ,\nMm-hmm .\nand it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . I've also known people to have  things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time .\nYeah .\nYep .\nLike remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down .\nYeah . Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either .\nSo we should think about\nSo you'd have the battery as the kind of  to keep it ticking over idea\nYeah .\nI'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here .\nYep .\nChip on print , is that  that's an industrial design thing , is it David ?\nYes yes .\nOkay um as for the case , kind of discussed that\nAnd this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small .\nYeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of  Okay .\nYeah I think so yeah .\nUm just a a lot of the um   I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made ,\nMm-hmm .\num but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there .\nMm 'kay .\nShould we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme  like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ?\nCould have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that .\nLike  Okay so so backlighting , that would be good .\nOr even a clear case . Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable ,\nYeah clear ,\nAye that would be a good idea .\nOkay .\nbut in the dark it sort of , it's alive  .\nYeah sure .\nUm in in a slight subtle way .\nS so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it .\nYeah that'd be really good .\nYeah yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse .\nIs that what you mean ?\nYou know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right .\nSure .\nSo the power  the battery in that sense ,\nYeah , yeah .\nmaybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights\nYeah .\nthat sort of\nSure . Yeah they they emanate a light through it .\nYeah\nOkay .\nbut because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky .\nLights .\n'Kay . Yeah ,\nOkay .\nmm-hmm . Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do .\nMm .\nCould we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ?\nThe question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ?\nOr\nDo you want 'em to roll it like that ? Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it ,\nYeah .\nMm .\nYeah .\nwhereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ?\nWell why don't we do it like a mouse then ?\nIf you're holding it in your hand you could\nThat's a very unnatural motion to\nDo you think ?\nyeah .\nOkay .\nCan you imagine you have to scroll a lot . Um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that ,\nYeah .\nbut not for channels right .\nMm .\nIf you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels ,\nMm-hmm .\nyou've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to  .\nYeah\nYeah .\nokay okay\nUm and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the\nYeah , sure .\num\nWell , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part .\nMm .\nI dunno . But users tend to tend to want to use that\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand once they lose out on the user experience they're like  Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of\nOkay .\nUh but\nOkay .\nBut that's not a bad thing is it ?\nJust\nBecause when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nJog dials are much easier than that .\nOkay um right well wouldn't it\nYou just roll .\nwe do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . Um I'm all for them actually , I think they're quite  you know th very quick to m to use .\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? No . And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ?\nYeah like I mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here ,\nUh-huh .\nI wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small\nUh-huh ooh okay , we really gotta wrap up\nI dunno .\nso yeah .\nYeah . It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side ,\nOkay well if we can do that , great .\nand that yeah\nYeah okay .\nwell I mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ?\nYeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um , and\nYeah .\nSo you wanna expand the shape of the\nAnd then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the\nThat that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in .\nIt would get bumped , it's  doesn't really fit with your hand .\nMm .\nYeah .\nMm .\nOr maybe just fit it in like down the middle here .\nCould I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ?\nOkay . Right I'm gonna have to\nA jog di\nI'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time .\nYeah\nUm is there anything anybody's unsure about ?\n. It's kind of yeah\nJust for  in closing just  the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that .\nYeah .\nSo um  that'll be that'll be good .\nHuh .\nUm and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ?\nUm\nUm I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um\nYeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it ,\nYeah that's what I was thinking the\nthat'd be great .\na slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand .\nYeah .\nI think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward .\nYep .\nOkay .\nThere's lots of space for it um\nThat's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah .\nYeah but it's also a a marketing and a function\nSure , yeah ,\nOkay .\nyeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard .\nTo make something flush with the case ?\nSomething a bit more flush , yeah ,\nOkay right .\nor maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well ,\nOkay .\nso that it has  and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .\nSp kinda grippy ?\nFeel like fruit .\nOkay .\nFruits kids  .\nThey feel kind of like um , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not ,\nNo like  Yeah yeah .\nthey're actually just plastic that's textured ,\nYeah yeah kinda like that yeah .\nkind of a little bit like\nOkay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . So um that's really good , like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so .\nOkay .\nSo off you go and design stuff\nOkay .\nwooh  .\nPlay-doh time .\nYeah quite jealous actually .\nYou got to choose first .  No , we're kidding .\nOkay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters .  Okay lemme  okay , I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . It's you . Argh . This is a real hassle and a  oops . I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's  too lazy t take them off again .

Remember , I'm an old man .\n'Kay , ready to go ?\nAll ready .\n'Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting .\nApparently I'm old as well .\nHopefully we've all got exciting ideas now .\nThirty's really young , eh ?\nWe do .\nUh k exciting ideas . 'Kay so here's our agenda our agenda . Um\nI'm gonna open . I'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do . I'm gonna take some notes . We're gonna all do a presentation , and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now .  Yep .  Well when I say hopefully , we have to . So\nAlright .\nI'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions . And does anyone really want to go first ?\nI guess I'll go first .\nYou p two ?\nYeah .\nWhat's\nComponent , I think . Yeah .\nComponents design .\nYep that's it .\nPresented by name .\nMy name is  .\nYour name is name ?\nJose he man is .\nMy name is name .\nHuh hi name .\nMy name is Inigo Montoya .\nYou killed my father .\nSorry I did this in a bit of a rush .\nPrepare to die .\nN name .\nRight .\nSo so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control . Um you've got  a printed  a printed uh circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber  nubbies into these little holes that activate\nWe've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah .\nYeah we've all broken a remote control .\nI've\nSo you've also got um  you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . Um\nI just love you tech guys , huh .\nYeah there's a thingy and a dingy and\nYou press this and it does th\nWell\nYeah y do jabber\nso you've got  here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal ,\num you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board . Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot  .\nI dunno who and whatnot .\nSo   exactly .\nNah .\nSo um we've got a  i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip  I dunno .\nP Yeah .\nUh it's two double A_ batteries .\nThis is pretty standard remote . So here are options for our power sources . You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um  th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that .\n'Kay .\nI wanna change that  .\nI don't know if that's really\nI I gotta I gotta flashlight , and uh\nI don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so\nOkay .\nYou shake it .\nyeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this  .\nYeah .\nLike this  .\nSo that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy ,\nAnd that's on the camera  .\nso it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it  .\nYeah .\n'Kay .\nUh we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night  which doesn't make a lot of sense .\nMm 'kay .\nAnd finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea .\nOkay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ?\nM battery versus cradle I think is  yeah .\nOkay .\nI like the kinetic .\nSo we have battery versus cradle\nI g I I figured you would . Yes .  Yeah .\nIt could be fun  .\nIt's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minute here ,\nYeah .\nyou could\nWell it is it is more uh  I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . So um\nMm . Hmm .\nour case design . We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and uh  Yeah pers\nWood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it .\nI think wood i\nIt it it\nNah .\nI I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know .\nUh .\nOkay . Hmm .\nUh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever  whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it .\nRight .\nOkay .\nAnd what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some  a couple of these . Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a  to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic .\n'Kay . Do you get a good grip on the rubber ? Yeah okay .\nYeah um\nAnd if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand .\nYeah .\nYou don't even need to lean down to get it .\nThe advantages of working with plastic and rubber is  w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape\nbecause you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . So um  and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um\nOkay .\nBut basically these are  curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department , in their um  in their  message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . I have no idea exactly what they're talking about ,\nOkay .\nbut that's what they told me ,  uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved .\nI would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes\nOkay .\nor surfaces . I have no idea .\nI think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a\nMm-hmm yeah that's  yeah that's what I see .\nyeah that's what  .\nOh okay oh like a wave , okay .\nYeah that's what I see also .\nAlright that makes sense okay . Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display ,\nOoh .\nor multiple scrolling wheels . Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh  has at his disposal to put together a user interface .\nOkay .\nFor electronics , we have these very technical um  descriptions here . A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you ,\na regular chip , which is  like the medium porridge  the  medium expense uh\nD do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ?\nYes the difference is , with a simple chip  a simple chip will operate  oh why doesn't this scroll up ? Previous previous , okay . A simple chip is required to operate push buttons .\nOkay .\nUm  an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display , and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels .\nOkay .\nSo but yeah .\nYeah that makes sense . So presentation from  I guess design would go best . Next .\nThat's the end of my presentation .\nTechnical functions or interface concept ?\nI think\nOh interface concept .\nYeah that's it .\nVery long presentation .\nYes , but it has your name on it .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "exciting, talking, mike, talk, ideas", "dialogue_id": 72}, {"text": "Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . Um so , somehow that thing's too big , but um  okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . They say they could put it to work but um we don't think so .\nNo .\nNo . It it it  you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and\nIf the T_V_ is working , yeah .\nThat's just  I mean it'll  if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel .\nYeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore ,\nSo\nand I think that's one of the things we wanna keep .\nBut what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? So if you pressed it and went , up ?\nThat kinda would r d\nWell then why don't you just press the up button ?\nMan yeah .\nyeah . That would kind of lose it .\nBut if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go  Up .\nEven still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ .\nThat's right .\nYeah , okay .\nIt might not be it might not be completely confusing , but I think you'll still y it's still\nI don't think it's practical at all . I think it's a bad idea frankly .\nOkay .\nYeah so um taking that away , our uh  the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable\nYou guys know your stuff .\nit's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . Um as for the point that we making about losing it . Well , we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost ,", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "speech, interference, remotes, buttons, channel", "dialogue_id": 72}, {"text": "That I would believe .\nabout\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nBut um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . Somehow . Um so  the the  what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without  with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext .\nSo we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ?\nYe no it's not\nThat's not a scroll wheel .\ni i it's just four buttons that are on a cross ,\nNah . Oh okay okay . I see .\nso that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that  alone .\nRight .\nUh , okay .\nInstead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter .\nOkay .\nYeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good\nand uh is not too prone to get lost . That be it .\n'Kay . So on to  Y functional requirements or trend watching ?\nI dunno .\nTrend watching has a later date there .\nTrend watching I guess . Trend watching I believe .\nforty six nineteen fifty seven . Yep .\nSee what it looks like . It's been so long .\n.\nWell  I don't know what to say . When I s when I see the  when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . I see so many of 'em out there . There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there .\nAre you talking about the picture ? That's not our that's not our b design ,\nYeah yeah .\nthat's just a  that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like .\nOkay . Okay . Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet .\nMm .\nAnd uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . That's what I understand so ,\nUpper management said yes .\nhello .\nUh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam .\nAnd and so  yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market ? Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin  there are so many people making these products at this price right now . What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ?\nWhat's special and unique about a scroll ?\nUh  well I don't\nIt's cool .\nyeah it's  I I just see it as different . I don't say it's specially mm  I don't say it's special . Uh I say that it's different I  what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . I need something to market about this thing . We're we're a new firm .\nI'd I'd say though that we  if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well ,\nWhat i  if when when we have\nbut wi with a similar\nyeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's  as as a marketing standard  I need something to market , to make this product unique .\nWell right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the  having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior ,\nYep .\nhaving it look really nice um and also be really durable .\nMm 'kay . Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here .\nMm . Course .\nRight yeah . Yeah .\nAnd and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . That's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase .\nYeah 'cause that's  .\nAnd so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet .\nMm .\nSo I need a product .\nMm 'kay .\nWell let's get a product then .\nI need a product to market . And I just  whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . Tha that I'm not concerned with .\nSo now\nIf you if you give me  if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost .\nSo our big  questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ? Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ?\nWell my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? Function-wise , what does that do that\nOh but that was in your presentation  so wh what would you imagine it doing ?\nYeah wh wh what's the  wh\nYeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .\nMm 'kay\nBut would we\nOkay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique .\nYeah .\nIf it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co  it's a very competitive market .\nWhat I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make .\nYeah .\nSo I d\nTh they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , I mean , it  I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know  if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use  if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . I don't think volume  or do you think volume would be\nI dunno . I'll bet first in volume maybe . I dunno .\nNo we can  we can do multiple scroll wheels but\nWell I d I like the idea of basically focusing the   my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the  uh dock to put it in  to to charge it . We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things .\nMm-hmm .\nIt s i m makes it easy to market ,\nYeah yeah .\nit's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so .\nI think it's  that's right . I think so .\nAnd if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often .\nMm-hmm .\nIt's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle .\nMm .\nSo if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well\nYep . I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now ,\nYeah .\nand and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness .\nSo our big decision then is like how do we do um like   we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh  What type of casing ? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber .\nMm-hmm .\nI'm thinking  yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there's  you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused  the plastic with rubber on the outside .\nOkay . Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for\nWell no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are are kind of\nOkay . So then if we   d d do we want to do anything more basic with the  uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for  um buttons , or do we want  if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? Do we want to give  do we want to have anything else on it ?\nIt's only a T_V_ .\nOr from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing  I mean it's  you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you  just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there .\nOkay .\nIt receives no information .\nHmm .\nSo I I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost . Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it .\nYeah . Yeah right now there's  right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the  a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the ,\nRight .\nI don't see the necessity of an L_C_D_ either . Don't see it .\nOkay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on  well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing .\nSo , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ?\nWhat what overall things have we not decided on ?\nWell we have to  I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? What do you guys like in the user interface ?\nI think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ?\nAgain . Well I think it's it's  the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere . And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . It's just another  it's just a an idea , and I don't know\nWell I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because  I think , as far as durability th it's not a big  well maybe when it's closed .\nI mean what I see  one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children ,  their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff .\nMm-hmm .\nThis\nMm-hmm .\nAnd what I keep throwing out there  I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different .\nMm-hmm .\nBut you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost .\nYeah and I guess th th the question th  th that you're being asked right now is whether  is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ?\nOh okay\nBecause the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost .\nphew .\nYeah .\nI think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features ,\nWell\nif that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost .\nThe   The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will\nMm-hmm .\nThat's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ?\nUm  we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine .\nNo it's just different .\nBut we I we will need a receiver , an antenna .\nIntegrated , yeah .\nYeah .\nSo it's just uh I I think that's\nIt should be a really simple signal though so\nI know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control .\nAnd it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep .\nThat's true yeah .\nBut I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? It's\nOh yeah yeah . It'll be really cheap .\nOr maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink .\nYou can\nMaybe not\nMakes your living room more fresh as you watch  .\nYeah yeah yeah yeah .\nOkay we're doing well for time here .\nS\nUm we've got about another ten minutes . I think that uh\nSo the scroll wheel , in or out ?\nMm pr my personal preference is out . I don't think the cost is justified  for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used .\nYeah . Yeah I think we have  like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing ,\nMm .\n'cause it's it it breaks down easier .\nYeah .\nFor me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad .\nI don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that .\nBut then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_\nW\nbecause some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so\nSure .\nif you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels . Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ?\nYeah .\nYou scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to\nWell I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain\nMm .\nOh yeah .\nUh I see I see . That's where you\nThat was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be .\nYeah .\nAh I see I see what you're talking about now . Okay .\nIt's just  it's basically  it it's just a f look and feel thing . It has the same exact functionality as two buttons .\nI I think there's  you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing  are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing .\nYeah if you're just sitting there going\nInstead of going button-to-bu you just  j you'd j j j j j j .\nYeah .\nThat's kinda cool actually .\nI really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing .\nI like that .\nNow just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip .\nWell there's ano\nWell not n necessarily .\nBut\nYou could basically make it so that it'll  I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once .\nRight .\nThat's right .\nIf you do that .\nYeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want ,\nOther than click click click . Yeah .\nbut I think once people get used to it  I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though .\nAnd if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , yeah , presumably .\nMm-hmm .\nPrimarily .\nYeah I think so . I I think so .\nYep .\nNow the the only thing I I   on the interface side of it , is that  I I I see the dilemma .  But if we have the option of of scrolling  at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I can go uh  presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two .  I know what  because it's on the television . The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it . So  I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ?\nMm-hmm .\nSo ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? You understand what I'm saying ?\nI think I know what you might be getting at , or or\nOh I see so if  maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? And then it  that basically\nOh no we could read it from the television .\nWell , what about this  what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels ,\nMm . Well that's quite cool .\nand it c it\nYou'd need a display on the th the thing .\nWhy ? It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ .\nYeah the the television can tell you .\nYeah .\nCan .\nOh yeah yeah no I see what you're talking about . Yeah that's kinda cool . How would you program it though ?\nWell you just  it's one extra button . You say programme start , and then type in\nPut\n'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually .\nOkay okay .\nSo programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter ,  thirty eight , enter , programme end .\nOkay and yeah\nAnd then .\nand that just basically flips between it and it'll go  it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nYeah that's kinda cool . I like that .\nAnd again we have another another great marketing tool .\nWe have about three  we have three or four things here .\nThat's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be  you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . You could basically  come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nI dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . This may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services .\nMight be , but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . The problem we're gonna have is making it robust . Making it last .\nOh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two .\nOr we go directional up  we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other .\nSo if there's a button  for each type .\nNo because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels .\nYeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they\nAh-ha okay . Okay , okay ,\nRight .\nwell then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch .\nYeah yeah the mode switch .\nI think we'll need a  we'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator\nJust the lights behind the buttons .\nto which , an L_E_ an L_E_D_\nYou could have back-lit buttons maybe .\nokay .\nWould that work ?\nYeah .\nIs that\nOkay .\nokay we have five minutes . So right details th  that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel .\nWe want  a mode indicator . We want  back-lit buttons . And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . I've seen some remotes do that .\nOkay . Just so you know I think  I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range .\nI think we are yeah .\nI wanna make sure everybody's okay with that .\nYeah yeah . Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this .\nYeah well we don't have  it's not that we have more money ,\nDidn't you say so ?\nwe can push up the the price .\nThat's what I mean .\nYeah .\nWe can increase the cost .\nOkay .\n'Kay .\nSo I don't know I don't know whether having\nI just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . So\nYeah . So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ?\nWell I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit .\nYeah no I I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . We're entering a new market here ,\nRight .\nso I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to\nOkay I'm I'm okay with that . I guess what I just want  to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level .\nBut th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ?\nWell y yeah . Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for\nWe have to find cost .\nwith all these features  how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ?\nBut you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market .\nI'm just asking you .\nI'm a student , but on the other hand I would think , mm with my Project Manager salary , I would think  yeah I could probably afford this\nIf\nThen you could probably afford this  .\nuh would I buy it ? Maybe . If I had a cool new T_V_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . Then maybe you know . I do I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly , that would be way too much ,\nOh no no .\nbut the  I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much\nI would say thirty five to forty .\nYeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty .\n'Kay . Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . So the question is what we ca we make it for .\nOkay .\nBecause one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television .\nMm .\nRight .\nIt's one of the marketing features in this .\nThat's why the scroll needs to be really robust .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "buttons, scrolling, slide, scroll, button", "dialogue_id": 72}, {"text": "Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator .\nWith a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd it's gonna look sexy  .\nOr not  .\nOr not . It might look like clay  .\nOkay so you can market pe depending on that ?\nYeah yeah . Bas th that's that's easy . That's that's not a , it's a  . 'Cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone .\nYep .\nCool .\nUnder the title of uniquenesses .\nHmm .\nOkay . The next meeting starts in thirty  minutes , although does it ? It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . So we've got more than a thirty minutes .

We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier .\nThanks , yeah .\nOkay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh\nYeah .\nOkay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ?\nI don't think so . If we have any questions we'll just email you I guess .\nOkay .\nYeah I think it  pretty much everything's covered .\nOkay .

Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess\nUh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on .\nAnd while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around .\nUh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal .\nDo you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ?  Um\nUh I do not think so ,\nAre we all gonna draw a cat ?\nI think it's just to try out the whiteboard .   Ah  .\nOnly animal I could thin I could draw  .\nI know .\nIts a sort of bunny rabbit cat .\nYou can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears .\nUh-huh .\nUm I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of\nOkay .\nRight , yeah .\nGreat . And the characteristics ?\nUm the favourite characteristics of the cat um  the whiskers I think , um because they're the easiest to draw .\nUh-huh .\nIn fact , I'll give it some more\nOkay .\nOh , and the tail\nFantastic . Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph . I think it's to get us used to using the pen .\nYes . Um sure it's not to test our artistic\nUh no .  A mouse-y ?\nIt's a mouse .\nThat's not a mouse-y , no .\nNo it's not a mouse . It's a wombat .\nOh .\nIt's a ratty .\nArgh .\nA what ?\nRat .\nA ratty .\nNot a mouse , a rat .\nA webbed foot . Webbed f\nIt's clothes . That's it's clothes .\nOh right  .\nIt's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail .\nAnd your favourite characteristics of that animal .\nI love whiskers . Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky  and uh fantastic pets\nOh .\nand very friendly .\nOkay . Kate ?\nAnd they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework .\nThanks .\nOh , a fish .\nGosh ,\nA shark ?\nwhy didn't I think of fish ? That's even easier to draw than cat .\nMm  this is very representational fish .\nOh , okay .\nFine .\nUm I like them because they're sleek\nFavourite characteristics ?\nand they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups ,\n'Kay .\nso .\nSo they have team elements .\nDo you have a favourite one ?\nI'm afraid I'm with Steph .

One hundred , fifty percent .\nAnd and your question is how many do we have to sell ?\nYes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is  has to do with marketing of  you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that .\nAt twenty five .

So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle .  So the first criteria . Do you all get what we're doing ?\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ?

As in the new high-tech\nWell , the kinetic thing , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .\n.\nSo it's  . So we'll give it a\nWell so the um\nIt's ergonomic ,\nbut that's not  that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah .\nYeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah . True .\nSo on the technical side of it it\nYeah . I'd say it's about a a twoish ?\nTwo .\nIt's about in the mid in the middle somewhere ,\nTwo .\nmaybe , yeah , I dunno .\nThree .\nYeah .\nMaybe three , yeah .\nthree . So criteria three is is it easy to use ?\nEasy to use .\nI think it's a one , I think .\nI'd say it's I wouldn't\nYeah .\nnot if you're left-handed it's not . I would give it a I would give it a two ,\nMm .\nTwo ,\n'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but\nso it's\nOkay .\nMm .\nBut if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ?\nIf we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nGive it a t give it a two .\nYeah , okay .

That was great .\nYeah .\nAmount of buttons .\nLike the amount of buttons ,\nContains only the necessary buttons .\n'cause people like a lot le like  So it's a one ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ?\nYes s yeah .\nYes . Very good .\nSo it's anti-R_S_I_ .\nIt's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ?\nIt's yellow .\nIs it easy to get lost ?\nI don't think it's gonna get lost easily .\nIt is very bright , yeah .\nNo ?

If you just reply to that one .\nSo there's no way to like predict what our  'Cause we had a  we originally had a   As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . It was fifty mil fifty million\nWas it was it fifty or five ?\nI don't remember . But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?\nIt gets handed over to another department .\nDepends how much we sell .\nUh .\nWhat our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically .\nHmm .\nthe for the  and just basically is it it come  can  is it within budget .

Yeah , that's it . You know , we've we've we've made i we've made\nWe finished an hour earlier .\nwe've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's  does everything that we wanted it to do . It's new , it's it's um something that uh  that isn't out there already .\nI think actually  and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know .\nMm .\nWe're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse  .\nYeah .\nMm .\nWell , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that ,\nDefinitely .\nit's  that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere\nOh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's  whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know ,\nMm . Mm .\nso that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new .\nMm .

It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before .\nMm-hmm .\nBut I'm not the authority to say that it is .\nIn  project .\nUm how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ?

So let's see if I can get\num here . I will draw a little turtle for you all . Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable . And you have the pretty little shell going on . Some little eyes . Happy . There you go . That's a turtle .\nYes .\nSo what are your favourite characteristics ?\nUm . I I like the whole having a shell thing .\nMm .\nIt's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw .\nExcellent .\nShall we just go around the table ?\nUh Okay . Well , my name is Iain uh\nMm .\nand I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um . And I'll try and draw my favourite animal .\nNo ,\nI'll  I should leave that one on there\nyou can erase the turtle ,\nshouldn't I  before I callously rub it off .\nit's alright .\nMight be nice to have them all up there at same time .\nUm I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um .\nIs that at least identifiable ?\nSnake .\nWell .\nEm\nWell ,\nIt's a whale  , yes .\nsnake ?  It's w\nThanks .\nOh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do .\nUm and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're  well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . And I just find them interesting animals .\nTake my contraptions with me . Alright , I'm Jessy . I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on ,  animal . Don't really know how to draw this . Just where can I  Mm . Mm . Maybe if I do the water ,\nbut how ? Sort of give an idea .  I have no idea how one would explain this . Mm maybe with some whiskers . Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal .\nYou can imagine it in the water . I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that .\nMm 'kay . Mm 'kay ? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager ,  from California . Um . Hmm .  S\nOh ,\nIt's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it .\na cat .\nUm it's actually a coyote .\nYeah .\nLet's see . Let's see ,\nRight .\nThat's impressive .\nlet's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth .\nThat's\nYeah .\nThat's pretty impressive .\nCool .\nOh dear .  Yes .\nI live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . We have coyotes howl all the time . So I really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . Mm .  Okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple  we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such  this is for television it's a  we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could  I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you  what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentation, meeting, powerpoint, collaborating, design", "dialogue_id": 75}, {"text": "Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload .\nI just wanna watch the T_V_  um .\nHmm .\nAlways gets lost . Some sort of like device to help you find it .\nI've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel .\nMm .\nSo especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um . I find them  they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of  in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .\nYeah um . I agree with having too many remotes around . My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them um . What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red .\nYeah .\nUm , I think there is a way around that ,\nYeah .\nbut I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on ,\nMm-hmm .\nso i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's  if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . So\nWhat about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?\nUm I would imagine all of them ,\nI know .\nbut we could  but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s .\nYeah , something that doesn't\nMm-hmm .\nUm like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nUm . Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . So how do we work with that ?\nYeah .\nMm .\nCould we get something that just has  No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for  that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off ,\nMm-hmm .\nchannel changing .\nAnd maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here ,\nYeah .\nthen all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the  whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together ,\nMm .\nN that way  Yeah .\n'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on .\nMm .\nYeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .\nUm .\nBecause that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well .\nYeah .\nSo like you have to have them somewhere ,\nMm .\nYeah .\n'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally .

Thank you . Okay . And uh Ed uh so what's  what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ?\nWell not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas ,\nHmm .\nuh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into .\nMm-hmm .\nIt should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh  the competition ,\nMm-hmm .\nuh th I agree it has to be something  it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use .\nYes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because uh she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay ,\nYeah .\nso because you need to sell  and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow .\nMm-hmm .\nSo , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay ,\nMm-hmm .\nand uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the  your sales plan , okay , th\nDo we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for ,\nTh That  that's\nthat's up that's up to us to decide , eh ?\nYes , that's  you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you  uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually . Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . Okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .\nVery good .\nOkay , I can coordinate ,\nVery good .\nor maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am I right ?\nMm .\nBetween uh all the coor\nWell , no , not exactly . I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that .\nYeah .\nSo I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work ,\nTh Christine , yeah  . Which is\nand so it's sort of  it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it .\nYes . Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay ,\nYeah . Mm-hmm .\nthen you will\nWhich will also feed into the marketing ,\nYes .\nbecause depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .\nYes . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nSo I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . Um , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account .\nYep . But what I request , okay ,  keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening .\nYeah , of course  . Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around .\nYes . Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management .\nSure . No problem .\nSo any questions for uh time being ?\nNo .\nSo , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or\nYes .\nokay .\nOkay . To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay ,\nMm-hmm .\nso then we can discuss about uh further things . So , we'll meet when the  we'll discuss on the further meeting .\nOkay .\nIt's okay ? Thanks for coming .\nMm-hmm .\nWould you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ?\nYes , I will . Yes .\nMm-hmm , yeah , that would be useful .\nI'll copy , uh le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ?\nSure .\nAnd if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or uh just come and uh knock my door , okay , so I'm available here .

Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nGood . Okay . Let's see what we can find here . Okay . A very warm welcome again to everyone .\nUm here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . Um and this is what we are going to do . The opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make uh minutes as I did of the previous meeting .\nAnd uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? Good .\nYes .\nAnd um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . But I think we will need it . Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation .\nI'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah .\nYeah .\nYou can go first , okay .\nWell .\nWell , shall I go first with the users ?\nWell\nI think  well okay no problem .\nIs there an order ? I haven't\neverybody already has his presentation ,\nJa precies , ja precies , ja precies\nso you can adjust it .\nSo . Huh ? Okay , um\nAnd one question , uh your name Denni , is it with a\nE_I_E_ .\nI_E_  E_I_E_ , okay . Thank you .\nOkay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . Um  well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . Uh when you press a button ,  uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh  button just presses on a\nSorry .\non a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh  a connection that uh gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . Uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled  to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . You know what a let is ?\nYeah .\nOkay .  And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . That's basically uh how it works . Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh  and chips .\nUh and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . Uh I made a little uh uh animation of  about how a tran our uh remote controller works .\nOh right .\nAnimation .\nwe tel\nThere is something turning .\nThere .\nYeah , it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board .\nOkay . Uh well\nthe sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh\nInfrared light .\nYes , uh , okay . Um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . Okay . S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too .\nYeah , I've got it there too .\nAnd it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged ,\nuh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs .\nYeah .\nOkay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and uh\nTo this meeting .\nOkay , thank you .\ntwo of these this meeting . So .\nShall I go uh next ?\nYep .\n'Kay .\nPlease .\nSo .\nSmoking .\nWell uh , my name's  , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . Um  I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it  I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . And that is my presentation .\nOkay , thank you .\nOkay .\n'Kay . Check .\nYou must still have it open .\nKijke  'Kay , so .  We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just  Yeah , and the users , actually .\nThe methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then  tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area .  Goed so .\nHmm .\n'Kay . Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often .\nYeah .\nSo we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore .  Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly ,\nMm .\nand fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . Next . Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those  they  those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . It has also be  have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off\nMm .\nHmm .\nor would be s uh  senden\nokay .  So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use .\nUh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ?\nYeah , touch screen , yeah .\nOkay .\nThe last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control .\nMm .\n'Kay .\nSo we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot  not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that ,\nbut like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use\nbecause you have  you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . And that is it .\nOkay ,\nOkay .\nthank you .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentations, meeting, meetings, presentation, design", "dialogue_id": 77}, {"text": "Oh right .\nUm , well thank you all , huh .  I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ?\nNo . Res I did not .\nNo ? Well ,\nPerhaps the rest ?\nNo .\nthen I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them\nJa ,\nso you can all read them . Oh , well not in this presentation . Hmm\nShould be in there . Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . Um teletext does  has become outdated since the popularity of the internet .\nOh . Mm .\nSo that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So we have to keep that in mind . Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . So , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ?\nWell you said it should only uh work with one appliance ?\nBe television .\nOr with one uh d che only the T_V_ ?\nYeah .\nYeah . Only be used for television .\nAnd the video also , or not uh ?\nWell it says only for television here , huh .\nOnly the television .\nOh . Alright . Okay .\nMakes it a lot easier , huh ?\nYeah .\nMm .\nSo yeah , then you can yeah . Requirements , no ? Functions .\nMm-hmm .\nThen it should have uh on , off ,\nYeah for\nand uh\nStandby options ,\nYeah , the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it ,\nyeah ? Uh yeah .\nYeah . And per perhaps uh\noh teletext doesn't have to be ?\nNo .\nUm other functions .\nWell uh uh yes yes s sh A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers .\nYeah I had\nTwo s two two digits ,\nYeah , yeah .\nCan you\noh okay .\nDon't know if that's got a name ,\nYeah I understand what you mean . Yeah .\nbut\nI think it's I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve ,\nIt makes it twelve , yeah .\nYeah . S\nIndeed . Okay .\nand that's that's not relaxed\nWell , not really\nto user .\nAnd and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function . So\nYeah .\nd uh wh the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve .\nSo that it  easy and fast .\nYeah .\nBut uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah , so you should have that one on .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "teletext, presentation, remote, television, design", "dialogue_id": 77}, {"text": "Uh yeah , think so .\nOur main targets' age are ? were ? Forty five plus , or ?\nMute misschien also .\nUh well\nMm .\nnew product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus .\nForties , okay because  because younger people as Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so I think to um  Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much , two years . You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nWith the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh  for fingerprint ,\nYeah , we we could yeah .

Because , yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical .\nSo perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen .\nAnd if the only f Yeah , because our target is sixteen to forty five .\nBut , do you\nYeah but uh will we not uh exceed our uh our uh production uh\nYeah you don't know how much it costs . Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen .\nIs it possible to find out , anyway ?\nNo , I don't have any costs here ,\nYou know ?\nI only have percentages .\nBut if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen .\nYeah .\nNo , an L_C_D_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here . Um just uh displays several buttons ,\nYeah ?\nfor example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen\nOh right , so you can\nand it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen .\nOh , yeah alright . So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen .\nYeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah .\nYeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen\nYeah yeah .\nand you get the buttons for audio settings ,\nYeah alright , oh right .\nso the other buttons are gone .\nYeah .\nYeah , yeah .\nSo we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ?\nYeah . Would be yeah .\nI think it's the most easier thing ,\nThat's my uh\nAnd hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive .\nyeah .\nWell we had twelve fifty , I guess , for uh production ?\nYeah .\nNo . Yeah .\nTwelve fifty .\nUm .\nAny guesses ?\nWell I suppose wi if the mar if our um  if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens , we should make 'em .\nHighly .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nAnd if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls\nBut  But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ?\nYeah , but  Um , s forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent .\nOh , so still a little bit people\nBut our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty .\nYeah .\nYeah that's right . But you don't want to alienate the other uh\nNo , that not now , but , so\nBut if they also buy it then it's alright .

Okay ,\nso  Yeah .\nbecause i uh when you get an L_C_D_ screen , you run it on batteries ,\nYeah .\nthe batteries will be uh empty very soon , very fast .\nYeah e e power supply is one of the most important things .\nYou should  Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off .\nYeah .\nIf you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno .\nYeah , yeah . Yeah .\nYou shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can uh\nMm-hmm .\nI don't know .\nUh\nYeah , I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it ,\nNee that's that's uh yeah .\nso I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down .\nBut then you can't\nAnd go to standby mode when you don't use it ,\nYeah .\nso that\nYeah .\nYeah yeah au automac matically , that it  yeah .\nYeah , automatically . After two minutes or three minutes , something like that .\nYeah . After two minutes , yeah two three minutes , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen .\nYeah . Sure .\nYeah .\nAnd then b that uh\nbefore an hour when its get again gets empty .\nYeah .\nThen you have plenty of time to recharge it ,\nMm .\nof put it in a recharger . Charger .\nSo we are going for the for the recharger .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah , if it's  . Uh .\nIf it's sensible .\nYeah , because when you're watching T_V_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger ,\nYeah . Yeah , b when the batteries are low\nNo ,\nand I don't think it\nwhen you when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television , you have to put it\nYeah , okay , but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go  hours , six hours , five , six hours , then .\nBut you'll also forget to put it in ,\nYeah sure , of course .\nbecause you throw it on the couch\nYeah ,\nYeah ,\nbut\nthen you have a problem .\nand you don't remember .\nBut you also forget to buy batteries ,\nYeah . That's right .\nand then you can you can't use it ,\nYeah .\nso I\nOr we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged .\nYeah .\nWell I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days ,\nSo .\nor not ?\nYeah because you have b\n'Cause\nbut you have L_C_D_ screen .\nYeah , that's right , but\nHigh power usage .\nHigh power user cell , i uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television ,\nYes .\nthat's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions .\nTrue . Yeah . Yeah . True .\nYeah . Right .\nOkay .\nYeah , you made a point there .\nBut then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch\nYeah , also .\nbecause otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ .\nYeah , otherwise all your  yeah . Just a small device  .\nYeah . I think everything has it for and  I guess .\nYeah it hasn't  It doesn't have to be big .\nPlug it in , that's it . Yeah , like a  like telephone charger or something .\nYeah just just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that ,\nYeah . Yeah .\njust u\nYeah .\nOkay .\nAlright .\nOkay , well I've\nIt has to be easy to use also , or things . Uh market share , speaker re speech recognition .\nYeah , you have some more\npoints .\nFunctional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen ,\nI think .\nso make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points\nAlso .\nuh , or\nWell I think that this should be standard . Large button  large buttons .\nYeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify .\nYeah ? Okay .\nBecause we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons .\nOkay .\n.\nAnd you said something about speech recognition ?\nYeah ,\nSpeech recognition ?\nit says also\nHello .\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nTwelve Euro\ntwelve fifty , twelve fifty .\ntwelve Euro fifty .\nTwelve . That's an  also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent .\nSo it's pretty big .\nWell , spread it by a big market .\nBut then I I I\nEven bigger than for L_C_D_ .\nYeah .  W I know let's do a speech .\nWell\nYeah .\nlet's leave out all the remote controls and just put a  microphone on top of the television to\nYeah .  Yeah .\nYeah . Ninety . Twenty five .\nYou can clap or something .\nYeah  Yeah .\nchannel .\nTurn volume up .\nYeah .\nHey , that that's an idea .\nNow you shouldn't say the wrong thing , I dunno  .\nOkay , well\nYeah .\nthat should  it has to be remote control , not\nYeah ,\nYeah .\ntwelve .\nBut they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something ,\nSure why not why not\nYeah .\nor ?\nIs this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . It's the only thing it says .\nYeah , mm .\nOh , but do we want to implement that , or ?\nI think an L_C_D_ screen  should be suf sufficient .\nYeah .\nBut when you look at the percentages\nYeah , it says a lot , but\nSpeech recognition scores even higher , huh ?\nPerhaps the options should be uh  Why not ?\nYeah , well ,\nWhy not ?\nmaybe because of the cost , but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh .\nYeah .\nLet's hope uh to have some uh d\nI know\nNo I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen .\nBut would it be useful to imple implement both ?\nMm .\nOn one remote ?\nYeah , if the costs al allow it .\nOr\nWell\nYeah , I dunno .\nI don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty .\nNee .\nWith that uh\nIf it should be done , if it could be done , I won't matter . Yeah .\nYeah ,\nWe should do it . Yeah . Sure .\nbut how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up ,\nYeah .\nor ?\nYeah .\nUh .\nCertain systems already exist , I think .\nMm-hmm .\nThen you also have to have different languages if we go international . Then uh it's y  it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English\nTrue .\nTrue , yeah .\nYeah . True .\nYeah .\nBut that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen .\nThis should be uh accommodated with some software , uh , uh . Yeah .\nBecause then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than um Swahili or something .\nYeah , that's right . Yeah .\nRight . Swahili . Swahili .\nYeah you can use icons for the\nYeah .\na speaker and uh\nJa , well possible .\nIndeed .\nBut if that's better than language for the for the remote .\nYeah , yeah yeah yeah\nYeah . So we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay .\nThen it's  Yeah .\nOkay .\n'Kay , what else ?\nSo , no speech recognition ? Or\nWell , if it could be done , we\nYeah ,\nY it should be done . If it could be done , should be done .\nwe have to keep  Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , and then we have different languages .\nYeah , that should be uh anything matters .\nThat's not so difficult at all ,\nOkay , just make a separate remote for each uh\nbecause I already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to uh not all , but\nWell , you sh you should to adjust the thing .\nI think it's difficult . Every language of dialects\nYeah .\nI think it's very differen difficult .\nAnd you have to speak the  so that it can understand .\nYeah . I think it can't be implemented , but maybe\nYou could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something .\nYeah , 's an option , yes .\nYeah , sure , indeed .\nFifty Euro cents .\nYeah .\nLet's do speech .\nFor speech recognition .\nYeah .\nOkay , so we only do this when we have enough money left .\nYeah .\nOkay . Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um  or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons\nMm . Yeah .\nMm , yes .\nin general .\nI  With uh teletext if  it wasn't ver very important , it was but\nNo , but\nYou also now have colours . I don't know if we should implement that . Yeah ,\nCurved ?\nwhen you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , and when you press the\nUh yeah .\nI don't know if we should implement that ,\nUm .\nbecause it says that teletext not really important ,\nS Shortcuts . Uh .\nbut yeah , the shortcut , and you can't go to sport .\nI think we should  we could that  we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus .\nYeah .\nMm .\nD Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it .\nSh Yeah , just just sub-menu . Yeah .\nIt should be available but not\n'Cause it should be there .\nNot directly uh available .\nnot  Yeah . Yeah .\nOkay .\nOkay , so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , and\nMm .\nYeah .\nSo actually it is there but it's just not r ready there .\nYeah , but s\nDirectly available .\nYeah .\nSo does it confuse uh the user ?\nYou'll have to search for it .\nThey'd have to be easy to use .\nUh . I'll search um .\nIf you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available .\nYeah . Yeah , that's a\nThe sign of it .\nOkay , but no more buttons or functions , or ?\nI guess not .\nNo .\nUh , no . What else can you do with a television ?\nWe've got anon\nAren't we forgetting something very important ?\nHave got got two examples here , but I don't think there's anything we're missing .\nUh play , pause , doesn't n need to be there .\nWell , we don't have the video orders\nYes , so this is your presentation . We could check the other remote controls with technical functions .\nYeah , you could look here all the the\nWhich ones were yours ?\nUh th th th th I don't know , technical functions .\nTechni\nThey're a bit small , you can  we should stretch them , because\nPing .\nJa ja ja ja ja . Technical functions . Yeah okay .\nI guess we've got them all .\nUh I think I go to have volume , mute but I  Yeah  . Very slow . Yeah , the zoom buttons .\nAnd for a T_V_ ? Can you zoom in a T_V_ ?\nYeah , b wide screen , high screen , different things you have ,\nOr that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and\nyeah different uh\nyeah .\nYeah .\nBut that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing .\nMenu .\nYeah it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something .\nYeah , so we should also implement se screen settings .\nMm .\nYeah , screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have .\nOh right . Yeah .\nChannel settings .\nYeah , so you can program the\nSo those four , and of course the main .\nYeah , so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can uh go to uh\nYeah . Yeah . Like tap screens or something\nYeah .\nor , I dunno .\nI hope we can do this .\nSomething\nThere are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got .\nYeah , if uh\n'Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings\nNo , you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't\nuh for uh\nthen you don't use it .\nYeah and if the television does not support such uh operations\nMm-hmm .\nWe don't have to use that top . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo you leave it alone .\nYeah .\nYeah . Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version .\nYeah . And do we want them in different colours , or\nYeah .\nAnd and the buttons , should they have colours ?\nColours . Yeah .\nColours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen .\nOh but we don't have any buttons . Yeah .\nYeah .\nI Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g\nYeah , then defines itself . Because uh how many percent ? Eighty percent ?\nThey think it's ugly , right ?\nWould spend more money if it looks fancy .\nOkay , so use uh very uh lot of peo\nPerhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones  .\nAdjust with phones , yes\nYou can uh   But I don't think that uh\nOkay .  Twelve Euro fifty . Well , make it available in different colours , you mean ?\nYeah .\nSure .\nYeah .\nRed , white , blue , black .\nAnd a see-through uh\nRasta colours .\nGrey .\nYeah .\nYeah sea view , yes , Simpson's versions and\nYeah , see through version . Yeah . If you press a button , it turns green .\nYeah .\nOkay , well\nLeave .\nthat's the\nA disco version .\nsignal for las final five minutes .\nFive minutes ?\nUm so I have uh the things I just read . Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ?\nYeah .\nChannel settings ?\nOh yeah , right .\nChannel settings .\nSo you can program the T_V_ .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nMm .\nPerhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . So , options , and then you sub them .\nYeah . Could be possible .\nOtherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not ,\nMm .\nbut\nOr like uh you have a menu button , you press\nNo , we said teletext also a separate menu .\nYeah , but I\nYeah , or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings .\nYeah . Yeah .\nOkay , but we can work that out later , I guess .\nBut\nYeah , no problem . Yep .\nSo we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like uh large icons or small icons\nI don't know .\nand I don't know what else ,\nUm ,\nbut\nNo .\nI think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen ,\nOr do we have any buttons ? On the remote .\nI think the buttons  Yeah , but but or like you have\nWhich one ?\nyou only have channel button or volume button . Those buttons you can you can\nYeah , but on the L_C_D_ ,\nBut that's also in the L_C_D_ ,\nhuh ?\nright ?\nYeah .\nRight , yeah , okay .\nSo we don't have any normal buttons\nYeah , th\nthat uh\nNo , no normal buttons , yeah .\nNo , alright .\nMaybe only the on and o on and off button .\nYet on and off is p is perhaps you kno\nBut we don't need a special\nUh not button\nBut I don't think\nwe don't need a special options menu for the remote itself .\nNo , no .\nMm , no .\nOkay .\nOh well , you should be able to set which T_V_ you have . If you have  if you have uh\nYeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control .\nYeah . But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , that you don't have to use a\nNo no no , because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is  it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically .\nYeah but but not for the remote but for the T_V_ , that you use\nYeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the  I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel .\nBut a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ ,\nNo .\nWell maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ ,\nyeah .\nbecause you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . So how do you turn the thing on ? There has to be a on button on the remote ,\nNo you just tap I think .\nhuh ?\nJust tap it .\nYeah , you tap .\nTap the thing . Okay .\nTouch screen , yeah then it's turn  turn off , turn on .\nAnd then the television is on also , or just the remote ?\nNo , just the remote .\nBut\nA television don't have to be on , that one you can  press on ,\nYeah , it should be in standby mode , but\nyeah stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then T_V_ should be available . Or not .\nYeah a yeah . I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just uh rubber uh for for T_V_ ,\nSeparate .\nso you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . Otherwise you  I don't know whether or not that's\nA A A normal button on the remote control ,\nYeah , yeah . To turn it on .\nor norm ?\nOf or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen .\nYeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on .\nYeah , I have ,\nOkay , well\nyeah .\nWh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button ?\nWell I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want .\nYeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button .\nMm .\nOh right .\nI think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control .\nYeah , I think so too . Otherwise y wet e k Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all .\nYeah .\nOkay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote .\nIf we can afford it .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay , well I guess we have to\nOh , okay\nYeah , if we can afford it . Yeah .\npostpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time . Um for now , we're having a lunch break ,\nOh .\nand then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this .

The yellow there is the um\nLogo .\nthe slogan , yeah ,\nOkay , brilliant .\nthat we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there ,\nOkay .\num but mainly it's speech recognition .\nOkay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah and  yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there .\nAlright , okay .\nMm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier .\nRight .\nYeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want .\nThat's groovy .\nYeah .  Uh can I have\nWell I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it .\nYeah , sure . Um that one is\nOh sorry s\nOh no , it's delicate .\nAt Oh dear .\nThat's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand .\nAlright , okay .\nIt does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand .\nOkay , brilliant mm .\nUm the black on the back is the slogan .\nOkay , nice and obvious there  ,\nUh yeah , that\nWell , we did think of that .\nif it's standing up , I guess , yeah .\nYeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle .\nOh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre .\nSo um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed .\nWhere you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of\nYeah . Well , if you hold it , you can  you all can hold it , is  it does actually feel quite ergonomic ,\nMm-hmm .\nif you've got small hands .\nYeah .\nMm .\nOkay .\nUm , obviously I don't think that's real sized  .\nYeah , okay .\nIt would have to be a bit bigger .\nYeah , scale model , yeah .\nOkay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and  um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom .\nAlright , excellent .\nWe used those  . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one .\nOkay .\nIt's not in the traditional place ,\nNo .\nbut um it's quite an obvious place .\nIt's out of the way as well , I suppose , so .

There we go .\nOkay .\nOh god , why is it doing that ?\nOoh .\nThere we go .  So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .\nMm-hmm .\nUm .\nMore like a traditional remote control .\nYeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nAnd by doing so  Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much . I don't know what's going on with this again .\nW why is the uh double curved two of them ?\nOh , good point .\nAnd double curve on both sides ?\nUm .\nCurve  . Yeah , this is double-curve ,\nThat's  sort of curve in and out .\nno ?\nIs i\nThis is double-curve . It  This one is single curve .\nMm .\n'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . So double-curve .\nNo , I think it means double curved as in um\nLike an S_ shape .\nlike uh  a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward .\nOkay .\nOkay , I might be wrong though .\nLike this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side .\nI don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape .\nHmm . Hmm .\nA curvature is like the  this case .\nOkay .\nMaybe .\n'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right .\nOkay .\ngot two of them\nYeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however .\nOkay . Well we can work around that um\nMm-hmm .\nRight . No .\nCut things out . But you think it should be one .\nIt's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there ,\nOkay .\nbut um  Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again .

Cool .\nUm\nSo we could even add something .\nWe cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately .\nWe should fire the accountants .\nWhat ?\nFire the accountants .\nAh yeah , we could add things .\nMaybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys .\nYeah .\nDoes that work ?\nYeah , I know , that just extends it as well .\nNo mm  .\nUh you can do one thing  .\nI don't know .\nYou just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this  Okay .\nIt  One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know  .\nJust uh just uh  Okay , just a minute . Okay . No input , like this .  Shift .

Um we've worked out what it would be anyway .\nDid you try both shift buttons ? It could be the other side .\nYeah .\nCancel . Piss off .\nThat's too bad .\nOh well , never mind . Um  . Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we  what could we reckon we could add ? Um\nWell maybe we could add something , but maybe if\nWell I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So\nWhat do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to .\nYeah .\nBut if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it .

Oh right , okay , you've got more , okay .\nYeah , yeah .\nOh , you got a presentation ,\nSorry uh .\nsorry .\nOh ok\nIt didn't bother to tell me that on this\nS\nthing . Is it ? Okay .\nUh  is the project evaluated , that is mine .\nDoesn't tell me .

Yeah .\nOkay , I didn't realise you had that bit .\nSo .\nOh could you pass the tomato please .\nSorry . Thank you .\nSo now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to\nMm-hmm .\nmeans uh at what standard what standard  whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is  will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this .\nOkay .\nWe will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as  fashion trends or not ? Means  because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays .\nMm-hmm .\nSo this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite  in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s\nSorry  . Sorry ,\nYeah .\ncarry on .\nSo  but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So  Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . I'm having this scale this scale ,\nOkay .\nso we have to do it on a board .\nMm-hmm .\nthe user requirem I think .\nAlright , okay .\nOkay .\nThe board working again , is it ?\nDo we have the uh the marker for the board ?\nUh .\nUm .\nThere it is .\nThank you .\nSo .\nSo these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . First of all uh comes user requirement .\nMm-hmm .\nSo we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . I I will  first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?\nUm  I think  Yeah , it did .\nS\nIt had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted .\nYeah .\nUm so .\nWhen the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ ,\nDoes it work ?\nso yeah ,\nYeah . So .\nSo what do you think you will personally give .\nof course we haven't actually got a working model yet .\nI would say seven .\nSeven . Uh .\nSeven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't  True or false ? No sorry tr one is true .\nOne , yeah .\nUh one is  means highest ranking , okay .\nYeah .\nBut I think highest ranking is seven , or one ?\nNo it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth\nNo that's false .\nOkay , right right . So it's one for from your point of view .\nOkay , so one .\nAnd what do you say our Industrial Expert ?\nYep .\nUh . It's hard to know . I I give it a two .\nUh d you can you can tell on on the like\nI think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert .\nOkay .\nBut you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ?\nUm yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um . But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons .\nUm  I'm gonna give it a two .\nTwo .\nTwo .\nAnd what about uh you , Brian ?\nOh , I'll go for a one .\nYou will go for one .\nBasic requirements but of the pro of the project .\nOkay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange ,\nYeah th\nand\nMm  yellow .\nUh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look .\nBut if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him .\nUh-huh .\nCome on that was the tha\nNo , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only .\n'Kay .\nUh-huh .\nSo we are showing our preference for particular fruits ,\nOkay .\nBeing fruitist .\ntwo or three kinds rather , and  Yeah .  So .\nIs that no is that not trends ?\nUh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that ,\nbecause whatever companies  they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things .\nMm-hmm .\nSome children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape .\nSo you can   what shape a person will like .\nMm-hmm .\nSo in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also .\nUh-huh . But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um  you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates .\nI think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have  That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . We were coming up with one product .\nUh maybe . Okay but I will I will personally  won't give it  beyond three .\nNo , I mean uh  obviously your opinion ,\nI'm just trying to  Okay .\nSo we can\nHe's a tough cookie .\nYeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . Three or four ?\nUh , no sorry ,\nit should be\nSix . Five or six .\nWhat are we doing ?\nWhat are we doing ?\nNo sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing .\nAdding them up ?\nWe're gonna average them ?\nYeah , yeah , we are taking everything ,\nOkay . So seven fourths .\nand that's  I have taken it very wrongly .\nOh .\nYeah uh\nAbout one point f one point eight .\nthree four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nbecause it is one point eight uh  two , so we will do two .\nOh I see .\nYeah round it up to two .\nYeah .\nOkay , yeah .\nSo trends .\nSo where were the trends .\nCan you explain what you want us to write there ?\nSorry ?\nHow it  how conforms to the current trends ?\nYeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the  uh as a fruit shape or something .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nUh .\nWell um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know ,\nso I would actually give it a three .\nTha three or four , I'm not sure .\nOkay . Yeah .\nThree . Go for three . That's fine .\nUh\n'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for\nMm .\nfor technology .\nYeah , I am sort of pret uh   Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might\nit might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um\nYeah .\nUh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well .\nOkay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now  our fashion trend shows that people like everything  all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them  or showing some association with them .\nMm-hmm .\nSo and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy .\nSo that is also ef that also\nMm-hmm .\nOur product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good .\nSo then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen  . So we can  Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ?\nYeah .\nUm .\nWell it was yellow .\nYeah , the company strategy , okay . Um  there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy a  two .\nWell , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nIs that the question ?\nYeah , yeah .\nIs it ? Okay .\nUm .\nOkay , so  one or two .\nYeah .\nOne . Okay , just leave it , it's fine .\nI'll go with two .\nSo what about you , Brian ?\nUm yeah , a three . Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a  a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by\nMm .\nYeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six\nSo one and a half .\nhalf .\nYeah , one .\nSo we can say two or one\nA two .\nOkay . So th seven seven . Uh overall we are getting two  something , but we can round it as two .\nYep .\nYeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good .\nCool , groovy .\nOkay .\nS\nSo we can launch it . Yeah .\nCool . Brilliant .\nWoo-hoo .\nIn which case we are done . 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget .\nOkay .\nCool .\nSo\nChampagne lunch anyone ?\nYeah .\nyeah .

You can call me Abbie . 'S see . PowerPoint , that's not it . There we go . So this is our kick off meeting . Um and I guess we should all get acquainted  .  Let's  shall we all introduce ourselves ?\nHi I'm Chiara , I'm the um Marketing Expert . Um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ?\nI think we'll get around to that , yeah . So this is just introductions yeah .\nWe'll get round to that later . My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert .\nOkay . I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already ,\num so .\nI'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer .\nI'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer .\nOkay . Um so f here's our agenda for today . Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .  Um so . So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . And to do this , we have to  um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . So . We'll get to that . Oh there it is . Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um  so we're gonna try out our white board . If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . Okay .\nSo you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ?\nI think both .\nYeah . Both . Yeah  .\nOkay . Why don't we do both . Right .\nWho starts ? We ought to decide who starts and  all that . No ?\nAny volunteers ?\nUh-huh .\nDoes anyone know what they wanna draw ?\nMm , I gotta think about it for a second like . Uh  Does it have to be  functional , trendy and user friendly ?\nI don't think so .\nUm . Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one .\nMake sure  my things here . Uh-oh . Right . Okay , my favourite animal is  see .  Oops .\nA dolphin .\nYeah , it's\n'S like playing Pictionary .\nYeah , I guess it has a fin on top too , yeah .  It's my dolphin .\nSo what characteristics do you like about your animal ?\nI like its tail .\nUm , no , I think dolphins are really uh  I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like\nThey're graceful .\nthey're graceful yeah , and they're so\nSleek  .\nYeah they're sleek\nand they look intelligent and I don't know , they're  I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing .\nI don't know how intelligent that one looks  .\nYeah he he doesn't look that smart  . He's a   I dunno um they're  I think it's cool the the um  the interaction that or the th things that  the reasons people seem to like you know  you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like   but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim .\nYes .  Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ?\nSuppose I can draw an animal , yeah .\n.\nUh-oh there goes the ten .\nYeah .\nIt's a cat .\nI don't know . They sleep all day ,  they're easy to draw  .\nDo you wanna  anything ?\nUh yeah .\nI dunno if the the\nI think the pen is running out of\nWell I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one .\nah .\nSo I'll use the spare one . Um but it's harder to draw  um .\nAnd the pen's dying  .\nUm .\nA horse .\nHorse .\nUh . Um I don't  really know how the legs go ,\nThat's very good .\nbut anyway I will do that . Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . Um\nYeah . This cord's   Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet  . Uh  It's a pig .\nSo I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? This is\nAnd furry .\nyeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah .\nTextile  tactile ,  tactile remote control .\nAlthough  uh I'll just put there . Right .\nYou're dragging a  you have a tail  .\nOh my gosh , this is disastrous . Sorry about that .  Okay .  So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country  . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .\nSorry can you just say that  what's the  what are our price goals again ?\nUm selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .\nOkay .\nHow many should we sell then ?  Um , a lot ,\nAnyone a mathematician ?\ntwo two two million ,  two mi no , more f four million .\nTwo million .\nFour million . And it\nwell it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .\nOh , yeah .\nIt is a lot . Uh .\nSo f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "introductions, meeting, introduce, discuss, designer", "dialogue_id": 79}, {"text": "Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find\nI was thinking that too .\nbec yeah  bec\nYeah .\nI think we should design something that has like a  so you can  like somehow like you  I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,\nI've always wanted that ,\nYeah .\nso like  you can push a button on your T_V_\nYeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .\nI mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not  yeah .\nYeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .\nYeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a  maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa .\nYeah . Yeah .\nIn which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound\nYeah .\nI don't know if it's expensive maybe to\nI don't  yeah I mean it  but like I mean\nMaybe call is enough . But yeah .\njust I mean like your phone even just has so  like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno\nYeah yeah yeah . Yeah .\nWhat if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could  I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base ,\nYeah . Yeah , or if it had a  yeah .\nlike just to have a home for it .\nYeah yeah yeah yeah .\nYeah ,\n'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so\nI mean\nWell that's why it's always in the couch .\nYeah .\nYeah  .\nYeah , in in the couch  .\nI dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and\nYeah . Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm .\nYeah so we   the project is now couches and remote controls .\nBut even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive .\nYeah .\nBut it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSomething like that .\nDo you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?\nAnd the other thing is\nBigger .\nNot  well it needs to be sort of\nLike Hand hand held size , yeah .\nHand-sized .\nYeah . I don't think you need a\nNot not huge , but\nBut definitely not  well I don't know .\nIt can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .\nNo , it can't be , uh-uh .\nNo it really wouldn't be .\nHuh .\nOr like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno\nLike spaceship .\n. Yeah  . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah  .\nThat would be really  I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop .\nLittle homing device .   Um .\nYeah  . Uh .\nOkay . So what do we think this remote control should  Five minutes .\nOh dear .\nTill the meeting  oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just\nI also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,\nYeah , I agree .\n'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and\nYeah .\nB_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .\nYeah , yeah yeah .\nI mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So .\nYou  what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does .\nThat would be cool .\nYeah .\nYeah . I mean it just seems like\nSo you could like um  like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can  the way you do it on your radio is that you uh\nyeah .\nwhat do you call it\nSelect . Uh .\ns y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s\nBut , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .\nThat's something we could decide . Mm .\nBecause\nI guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno .\nBecause , I don't know if it's   I think it's e expensive , if you have  if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nand then use the telly as a screen .\nRight .\nBut um\nI'm thinking kind of\nBut yeah for sure . Something like not  it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do ,\nYeah .\nis that what you mean ?\nYeah .\nRight . Mm .\nOr like you h you see those you know people  I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those  these things that at their house you know  their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that  and it's like a hand held like  turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like  so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if  it must be  it would probably\nYeah .\nmust be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .\nMm .\nBut like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .\nYeah , yeah . Yeah that's true .\nYeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point  twelve fifty for  to actually make the device .\nYeah .\nMm .\nUm but it's something to think about , yeah .\nWell , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah .\nI mean we'll have to see how much that would be .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "phones, remote, vibrate, phone, mobile", "dialogue_id": 79}, {"text": "Or some  it i we can find out probably on the internet  how much it's\nYeah .\nUm .

Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . Um can I just put this on ? So we have to work out a way  what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . Um . This is  to do this I will not remove my microphone .  We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um ,\nand as part of this  The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . The most important by far was the look and feel of it . It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out  . It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . People will wanna buy it . Um  That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative  has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . People have to then think about it and say  got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to  be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nUm I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . That would make it stand out . Um .\nHmm .\nSo can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ?\nSpongy feel ?\nUh about the feeling yeah uh yo\nWell\nYou can\nma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart ,\nOkay .\nMm .\nrather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSo as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those  a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um . Textured feel we just talked about . Maybe it's another way of doing that .\nMm-hmm .\nSo if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe  to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever .\nYeah that's a very good idea , yeah . Yeah .\nUm and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . They're big selling items . People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't  I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . I think we're better doing something basic like this\nMm-hmm .\nwhich is very important and very  will be a really cool feature to put in . And   use . I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves ,\nMm . Yes well\nand then\nmaybe Matthew can can give some more information on the\nyeah\nYeah .\nand then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate .\nMm .\nYep  and that's the presentation .\nVoila .\nOkay good , that's very clear .\nYeah .\nYeah very clear .\n'Kay . Um . Uh\nSo does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? I think you\nMaybe we yes well we maybe  can decide later on um  the l the the look and feel of uh I've  it was a good idea maybe to to\nTo let the people choose ,  you mean ?\nYes the the the there are changeable covers ,\nYeah .\nbut on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because  you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies\nHmm .\nuh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational\nWell we're selling so many units of this . This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .\nHmm . Mm-hmm .\nYeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects .\nMm mm .\nYes . Mm-hmm .\nSure that fits the\nYes  and of course it will be a we we get a  if it works we can get uh after-sales\nMm .\nI mean that would  would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro  .\nYeah .\nMm .\nThat's a very good idea um  And then uh maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation because\nYeah\nMm-hmm .\ns\nthe\nthen we could discuss later like  we can put all ideas together .\nTogether indeed uh ,\nMm .\nIt should be easier with that .\nbecause you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use ,\nYeah yeah I agree .\nMm-hmm , yeah .\nwhat you were already mentioning .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo\nAnd your part is very related to mine\nYeah .\nbecause when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside .\nYeah so  I'll I'll go with that actually\nMm-hmm .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, presentation, presentations, matthew, talking", "dialogue_id": 80}, {"text": "so um   Okay so m so  then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo what I have found was that uh currently uh the  they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have\nMm .\nand uh   There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like  You can basically  if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the  T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information  .\nMm . Mm . I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . That's a good idea .\nYeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly ,\n.\nMm .\nYeah .\neven if you arrange it by  however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to\nHmm . Mm . Yeah I really like that idea .\nSo what functionalities do you suggest for that ? For facing this problem ?\nSo it it it's like it  limited one . In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for  eighty word thing , eighty word ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhich shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control ,\nMm .\nyou want to st store your favourite channel .\nMaybe ten channels , yeah at the most .\nYeah some ten twelve channel information . You know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that .\nOkay .\nMm .\nAnd uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are  having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is  now , so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm . Oh yeah yeah yeah mm .\nto model the functionalities will increase actually ,\nMm .\nMm .\nand for you and you might want\nMm .\nyou don't want separate keys for all of them . You can't . And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present .\nMm-hmm .\nI personally would look at  things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having  unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition .\nMm-hmm .\nI got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine ,\nMm b\nand so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , you know , and uh\nBut a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary .\nYeah you you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word\nMm . Mm .\nand it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing\nMm .\nwhich is again  and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like uh it could indicate you're uh  it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking .\nMm .\nYeah .\nAt the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also\nor\nAnd you want okay  for coming back to one point\nTwo thirty five supposed to finish .\ny you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ?\nYeah you can let them to do that .\nAnd uh isn't that too difficult for the  we want w I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use ,\nHmm .\nthat's the  compromise .\nN no but the  if you give  it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nLike for example uh I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user\nMm .\nor you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint .\nYeah .\nYeah . Mm . I think you can do it both ways .\nSo it de\nYeah .\nYou can have it so it's easy  they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it ,\nA standard .\nor if they want to they have the option of using these extra features .\nYeah .\nUm yes but but I do\nSo\nYeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "buttons, remote, keypad, functionality, channels", "dialogue_id": 80}, {"text": "maybe you can  give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents .\nSo\nHmm .\nI'm sorry to have   Every time I have to come down on this price again\nHmm .\nto  so this might be a little limiting for your creativity ,\nHmm .\nbut it's it's it's the real   We have to consider it .

Yep .\nYes yes you can you can still . We have time .\nSure you can you know  .\nOkay . So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you .\nMm-hmm .\nSo the method is  ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like  , and uh what cost  the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . So there are two uh different types of uh um  Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control .\nNice .\nHmm .\nUh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an  that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board  buttons , infrared  , led , etcetera , for the components um . So you  finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nand uh uh that's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um . So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . And uh so I think  for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology ,\nYeah mm mm-hmm .\nand this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to  them and connect them .\nMm-hmm .\nSo my personal design  we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . If it's plastic\nMm .\nor you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or\nWell well\nI dunno .\nm m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up .\nYes . Yes .\nMm-hmm .\nSo like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nYes .\nMm just have a yeah\nYeah like they do in with cars I think . Yeah inside the car\nJust the veneer on it , yeah .\nyeah . So they also emailed me that uh they have  available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a  computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays ,\nYeah .\nso I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . And the final point okay is um we have  yeah there are some uh compromise to to do .\nHmm .\nSo we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright . And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but  I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that .\nMm-hmm .\nSo to  to sum up um we need  yeah so I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert\nSorry .\nMm .\nso that we can  it's really a team-working uh . So\nMm .\nI I cannot design something without your agreement ,\nNo of course .\nYeah so\nright ?\nof course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there ,\nYes .\nor if you want to store a programmes with a keys  What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside  W wh what\nYeah it's kind of um simple  pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert .\nW what  Okay . Okay .\nI think we could insert one that could underlie several functions\nOkay so\nof\nin that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the  card .\nExactly yeah , for customizing and yeah .\nYeah where they do all the wi with with them actually . How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things .\nOkay .\nSo\nYeah . Yeah good idea .\nSo I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this .\nYeah .\nUm so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features .\nExactly yeah that's a very good idea ,\nYes .\nwe could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nand\nSo\nyeah .\nwhen the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip .\nYes .\nD well\nDo you think that's feasible ?\nWell I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know .\nUh  You th you think it's possible .\nIs it possible to fit in to that ?\nYeah also thinking , I think both uh  if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay ,\nSorry .\nHmm .\nbut uh   .\nWell maybe we need specific costings then . Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better .\nMm yes\nYeah that's an excellent idea .\nwh when you make a  a design ca you can   next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price .\nYeah yeah . Yeah\nMm .\nThat w that would be a very good idea .\nbecause right now I don't have  price in in head\nMm .\nbut for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that .\nGood good .\nYeah that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . For example if f if you want to put wood  I wouldn't suggest for wood\nYeah .\nuh  'cause it's  I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber  rather than wood .\nOkay . I agree on that . Yeah .\nMm .\nIt will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , but\nYes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials\nHmm .\nYeah .  Yeah\nwhich which come with a with another price .\nit's uh   Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is  but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is  it's much better with that rather than going for\nDo do you agree ?\nMm yeah sure .\nYeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood ,\nYeah .\nand we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh  graphs or I don't know uh\nYeah .\nUser Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that .\nMa I I think uh for next meeting we c  you two can present a real design . Uh so drawing it on the board .\nYeah .\nYea\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nPerfect yeah .\nAnd then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . So um  Let let's say next meeting w  you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .\nYeah sure . Yeah we will uh  Yeah .\nYeah .\nMm .\nUh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case\nUh .\nwhich can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it .\nMm .\nBut that that that that can be done later .\nYeah .\nWe now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control .\n.\nYeah customized .\nMm .\nUm .\nOkay   . We can give them smooth keys , you know . Smooth keys with bigger s uh  So that you know  The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small ,\nMm .\nYeah .\nand every time we have to be very  but if i the  if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together\nSo is there any of these that you're looking at particularly\nto\nor is this just ideas ?\nOh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here ,\nMm-hmm .\nand uh  now you can , for example , as I was  if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people .\nHmm . Mm . Mm .\nMm-hmm .\nAt the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all  problem .\nMm yeah .\nYes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think .\nUh big keys may better  for them actually and uh\nYou see ?\nI agree yeah ,\nYeah .\nand not too m too many keys of course yeah .\nMm well\nNo no .\none I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom\nYeah .\nso the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys .\nMm mm mm .\nYeah .\nMm w but then you have still have uh when you don't  use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control\nMm .\nwhich you don't use . So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much .\nYeah .\nMm . Yeah . Um yeah I've seen that before too . Anoth another like b\nYeah .\nit flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath .\nYes .\nYes . Yeah so it's something like this , the model here\nMm .\ns  you can put the keys\nMm .\nBut I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well .\nThat's what you mean ?\nYes I I th that's what I mean\nYeah . Yeah .\nso I mean something like like a book .\nI like this one . I like the shape of this one .\nYeah .\nCan we have  can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box\nYeah I like also this one .\nthat's a  maybe curved or something .\nYeah , mm .\nYeah , the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should  dec decide numbers or\nMm mm 'kay . Is this for the next meeting though ?\nWe should make a\nI think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting .\nMm .\nYeah that  yeah next meeting we should be\nJu just make two designs ,\nOkay .\nYeah that would depend upon us actually .\nYeah yeah yeah .\nand the we we can decide decide between th those designs .\nYep .\nYeah okay .\nI think that would be a good idea . So\nPerfect .\nanyone uh any questions for now ?\nNo no . I don't have .\nNo . So is this  is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ?\nUm yes I come to that uh uh\nMaybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that .\nYes well m maybe uh , I don't know whether that's possible ,\nMm .\nmaybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow .\nOkay well is this  me designing a way to evaluate it so  Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ?\nI don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time\nMm .\nbut a as far as possible .\nOkay . Yep .\nSo uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes\nExactly .\nMm .\nYeah .\nand further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email .\nTwo or three prototypes ?\nTwo .\nTwo .\nOne for like cost and the one with like higher-end\nTwo ?\nI\nOkay .\nMm .\nMm  and then\nso that then we can be easily comparing them\nYeah\nHmm .\nor you know find a compromise between both of them ,\nand find maybe a compromise .\nHmm .\nYes okay .\nyeah that's how it is .\nMm-hmm .\nPerfect yeah .\nYep .\nOkay let's call this to an end .\nMm 'kay .\nOkay .\nThanks guys .\nThanks .\nSo we are done for now .  .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "detect, remote, buttons, display, battery", "dialogue_id": 80}, {"text": "Help .

Can I grab the\nUnplug me .\nThanks . What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ?\nUm , F_N_ function F_ eight .\nOh right , yeah . Okay . Maybe\nYep .\nYep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .\n'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What  the first thing  question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that  well it wasn't really my area because  I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one  .\nUm and uh  I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .\nMm-hmm . Could I  can I interject to ask a question there ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah sure .\nis that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the  surrounding it ?\nUm no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,\nMm-hmm .\nthey have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in .\nRight , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?\nYeah the the\nOkay .\nThey are .\nwell you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption\nOh I see .\nand how much you need to send the data across .\nOkay .\nUm , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .  Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the  w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh  just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do .\nIt's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the  uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would  the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to  whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and  reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the  it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of  d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa  thing that you could have ,\nMm . Mm .\nI  th that was just sort of a general point there .\nMm .\nAnd that's uh  yeah .\nThat's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .\nAlright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there ,\nOkay , thank you very much .\nso if you wanna\nUm , would you like to continue on from that ?\nYep .\nOoh .\n'Kay . It can be\nOr , maybe move the laptop over .\nokay , that's okay with me .  further .\nOops . Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ?\nF_ function .\nFunction F_ eight yeah .\nOkay . Mm why's it in the right ?\nNo . The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No .\nYeah , it's connecting  .\nNo , no yeah it's just  .\nMeter adjusting .\nokay .\nOh , there  .\nYeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,\nYeah .\nbut basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's  it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering  maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will  this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you  you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like  it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh  added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not  of no use of punching in the uh  trying to put in those things in  on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,\nYeah .\nwith that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in  add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's  so this is  if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use  usage and all that .\nYeah .\nSo in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .\nMm .\nUh any comments like , if you want ?\n'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end ,\nOkay .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "powerpoint, unplug, signals, signal, powered", "dialogue_id": 81}, {"text": "okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um\nYeah sure .\n'Kay .\nOoh , it's vibrating , that's strange .

Right , okay .\nI think you'll have to\nHave I got to keep this here ?\nYou can't\nDoes it matter ?\nIt'll have to  this can't be pulled .\nI'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ?\nWe just do the best we can .\nUh , whoops .\nYou'll have to push it a bit more .\nWill it manage ? Bit more ,\nYep .\noh dear .\nYeah this is more than enough . Okay .\nThere we go , I've got a bit more of the cable  .\nOh .\nThere we go .\nIs that okay ?\nYeah I think you can pull it out now .\nThank you ,\njust pull it closer a little bit .\nUh you should be able to  and\nYeah , you might .\nyeah , there you go .\nGet it right over , okay , thank you .\nAh . Look at that .\nOkay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .  Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .  Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,\nYeah .\nso you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there .  Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take  said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh  when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this .  I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,\n'Kay .\nbut I think I'll just keep it simple ,\nif there's any more information I can email you extra details ,\nThat's fine .\nOkay . Yeah .\nOkay .\nis that okay ?\nRight , um\nHuh .\nwe have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext ,\nOkay .\num apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um  our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that   it limits the cost for us ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .\nMm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?\nIt says for T_V_ only , so  looks like it's just\nJust channel-hopping .\nyeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but  I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well .\nWould that imply video use ?\nT yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g\nI mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ?\nYeah . If yeah\nMm-hmm , yes .\nand if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .\nMm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and  programming .\nAnything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?\nYes .\nYeah .\nUm we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons ,\nTen perc\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nI think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on\nYeah .\nand I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare\nOkay .\nHmm .\nJu um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing\nMm-hmm .\nPens\nand they're not that great anyway .\nIn fact I've just called up that table there ,\nAlright , okay .\nwe asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?\nAlright , okay .\nSo you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nand a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology .\nYeah ,\nYeah but um on on that again I just thought  'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is\nMm-hmm .\nbu\nOh yeah .\nso I thought that could be quite a\nRight .\nWe do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing\nMm .\num because it is something I  it needs to be  the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nmaybe  on the T_V_  you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps\nOkay .\nand you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that ,\nYeah .\nYes . That's a super idea .\nbut that's  that sounds a lot cheaper to me .\nHmm . Yeah .\nYeah .\nUm  the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well .\nYes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty\nYeah .\nand also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno ,\nMm .\nyou get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may  and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .\nYeah .\nSo are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs  ?\nYeah .\nSure .\nWell y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs\nAlright .\nI mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .\nRight .\nMm-hmm .\nThe features could be same and the body could look slightly different .\nJust\nYeah .\nyeah , yeah .\nMm .\nSo\nWhat about  you were talking about the buttons ,\nYeah .\num the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers\n'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just  yeah .\nyeah ? Um so you  it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the\nNo , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to  you don't actually have to press them you just\nYou don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .\nYeah .\nUm , think that might appeal  I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people ,\nMm . Mm-hmm .\ntrendy kind of a thing .\nYeah .\nYes it will appeal to sections of the market def\nUm , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can  oh yeah that's obvious what that's for\nMm-hmm .\nand it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um\nMm-hmm , mm .\nMm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um  if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big\nWere too big .\nbecause um  they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands\nMm .\nso they couldn't get round the controller which is uh  so if you  I don't know what  'cause you  obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .\nYeah , uh maybe to  as uh  it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control\nYeah .\nand maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .\nI think we have to design one product\nHmm . Huh .\nand then the company can take it wherever they want to uh\nYeah .\nin the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nTh the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .\nIt's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .\nYeah .\nI'm j I really can't get my head round this one ,\nYeah .\nthis may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about .\nI  yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause  without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel\nMm . I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .\nand it becomes\nOr a speech recognition ,\nyeah . Yeah , speech recognition ,\nYeah .\nwhich is extremely expensive ,\nbut\nI think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue .\nyeah .\nYes . Mm-hmm . Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um .\nWe could focus on the biggest market .\nMm .\nMm .\nIf say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?\nGe uh\nAnd when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .\nWe are  we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable ,\nthey want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume  associate that with the older generations .\nMm .\nNow with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people ,\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm  .\nbut I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people .\nMm . Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate\nMm-hmm .\nand uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first  it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .\nOkay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ ,\nMm-hmm .\nwe've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,\nVideo plus .\nyes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that\nYeah yeah .\nI always found that really easy when I discovered it , um\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nbecause you've got your general record anyway so if you  there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in\nJust whack in the number .\nand it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that ,\nAnd you w\nit's just a number .\nyeah . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that ,\nNo .\nyou just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway ,\nYou've already got the numbers for typing in anyway .\nyeah .\nRight , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful  .\nIt is\nafter um  if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards\nIt's not  Yeah .\nand that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth\nAh , hmm .\nso you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times ,\nRight .\num and it has been around for quite a long time .\nIt's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .\nNo it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that\nSuperb . Mm .\nMm .\nYes .\nThough if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it  you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on\nMm .\nRight .\nand you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .\nExcellent , mm-hmm .\nSo that  yeah .\nMm .\nBut just to have that function would be would be really good .\nRight .\nOkay so\nCan I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me ,  to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it ,\nYeah .\nthey'll phone the company , you can use their telephones .\nMm-hmm .\nIs it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?\nMm .\nBut the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um  the companies who uh who you deal with have actually  they've they've got an obligation to to help you out\nMm . Mm-hmm .\nand also  I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having\nRight .\nThe functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ?\nAlright .  Yes\nIf it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel ,\nbut I mean for  if there were any more  or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video ,\nI think so .\nYeah , I mean\nwe're not gonna put any   okay , just a thought .\nUm\nI mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .\nInstruction manuals . But I mean they're  there's customer service ,\nOkay .\nthere will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to\nYeah . Department , yeah .\nMm-hmm . Sure .\nand that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um .\nMm .\nRight .\nYeah .\nI think it will be too much of an effort for a person to  for a phone maybe he might walk down the street ,\nYeah .\nbut for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .\nAnd they're\nNot for such simple functions\nyeah , they should be f yeah .\nbecause we're focusing on that ,\nMm . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible\nyes okay .\nSimple .\nbecause a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages .\nYeah .\nMm .\nYeah .\nPuts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .\nIt does ,\nIt's the uh\nyou just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong\nyeah .\nand then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about .\nSure , okay .\nMm-hmm .\nUm , what other functions ? We need  I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about  c 'cause you've got the dilemma between  oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?\nUm they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but\nWell they la they they last quite a long time ,\nMm-hmm .\nand if you had uh  when you  th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something ,\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nbut it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .\nYeah .\nUm , something like that should reduce the size of it .\nYeah and if  yeah if you if you had if you had one of those  uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh\nYeah it could be on that  yeah , okay .\nYeah on that as well so .\nSo are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?\nS\nYeah\nYes .\nsome sort of docking station or\nMm-hmm .\nRechargeable with a docking station .\nyeah .\nSo the rechargeable which would be your field .\nYeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine ,\nOkay .\nand also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .\nRight .\nYes ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhich it is cheaper in the long run as well .\nYeah .\nUm , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nbecause then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many   how much you try and make it simple ,\nMm .\num\nAnd we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical ,\nThey do .\nYeah .\nthese long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely  an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that .\nOkay so we've got a flip-screen .\nOkay .\nUm\nWhat I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate .\nYeah .\nThat's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here ,\nMm-hmm .\nand you don't have to  you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .\nSlightly curved , curved .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nG uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't\nMm .\n'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway .\ny yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your\nMm .\nthe way you h hold of  it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nI wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth .\nCan you look into the company logo ? Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .\nCurrent .\nI mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\num something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design ,\nwhile also making it quite different from anything else that's there .\nWe could look in at that but  Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells ,\nI mean look at the mobile .\nlogo could become as  you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .\nWell we need to think about how it's gonna look different .\nI think that's   that sounds a really attractive idea ,\nA sea shell ?\nI've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of  yeah and that opens out into your flip-top .\nYeah .\nThen it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea\nYeah we could look in at that .\nand plus you can get   you know even though we're using plastic , you can still  I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .\nOr you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nSo you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and\nYeah . Mm-hmm . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa\nYeah .\nand people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't  not gonna lose it so much  either . It's easier to  bit nice to handle .\nMm .\nYeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are  whichever appeals the most like ,\nOkay .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nthat could be the most common design .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nBut we can like think of five , six designs .\nOkay .

Right . Right , so when they press for programming you  it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and  Or was  is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just  that was an add-on feature ?\nIt's  kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .\nUh-huh . Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ?\nUm it could be it c It  yes ,\nYeah .\nit could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature ,\nRight .\nyou know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .\nMm , and the rechargeable batteries .\nYeah .\nWas there anything else there that we  in the new new project requirements ?\nUm\nYeah .\nWe've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at ,\nYes . Yes .\nwhat preference  so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .\nAnd we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .\nFor detection , right .\nYeah .\nLearning how to use it should be as simple as possible .

Well then then we're gonna put it in .\nOkay , just\nYeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh\nYeah , and   Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know .\nSlide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .\nIt's probably better . Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you  other functions .\nIt's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .\nMaybe that's better . Yeah , that's that's a very good point .\nYeah .\nOkay , so when you have a lot of room inside .\nThink that's better .\nSo you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .\nYeah . Okay . So this is okay ?\nNo . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .\nOkay , so that's  Uh I'll just have a look how much that is .\nThe\nBut um  Okay , for the\nAdvanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .\nOkay .\nYeah , I I think so . I don't know .\nNo , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So\nOkay .\nAh okay .\nSo I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .\nGood .\nSo you can show your prototype if you want to .\nTogether ?\nYeah . Yeah , it's  Let's do it together .\nI'll give comments .\nOkay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it .  Uh the material should be hard plastic . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements . Uh we have  The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel .\nOkay , cool .\nAnd this is the the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic .\nOkay .\nAnd the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger .\nMeans\nSo you hold it like this in your right hand and\nMm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?\nSpeech recognition .\nYeah , speech recognition . Just  Only one button to say it's on or off .\nUm I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .\nUh I dunno .\nUm so I've\nYeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .\nYes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .\nSo you can put it on the back as well if you want to .\nYeah , you can  put 'em all on the back . That's for sure .\nYeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know .\nOkay .\nThat's uh\nWell we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .\nOkay .\nWe also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But  You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .\nYeah , you can put it separate .\nYou  Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So  But it's enough room .\nYeah . Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh\nUh well\nYou wrote this , so .\nWell the main , the main zap buttons are most central . That was the the most important thing .\nSo uh the best  place , the best reach place  Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's  basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .\nYeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then .\nYeah .\nJust just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine .\nOkay yeah , they\nBut you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .\nMm yeah .\nYeah okay . That's that's below that then .\nYeah , okay .\nIt's uh twelve buttons .\njust so you get that .\nOkay , but   It's rather important .\nYeah okay , just we just missed that .\nYeah .\nBut um I'll just uh  I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . Um  The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you   That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .\nOkay .\nSo that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh  in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .\nOkay .\nAnd also in the num-pads , there's also colour  light behind it .\nAnd do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?\nSo when you pre Yeah .\nHow do you want to implement that ? Just on the  Maybe on the second level as well ?\nWe're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little\nYeah , these are just basic functions , so\nAh .\nAll the non-basic are in\nOkay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .\nYeah .\nOkay . Um\nOkay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player .\nOkay , maybe we use this button for the\nThat function must be  Yeah , maybe  Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .\nYeah ,\nYeah , as well .\nI um\nJust make make a\nTo your video device .\nYeah .\nJust just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .\nYeah .\nA second level ?\nYeah .\nLike a a new blank one or  Or just here ?\nNo no , just on  Down there .\nIs i Ah okay .\nSo uh\nOkay . Yeah .\nAnd h how does the second level come out ?\nJust uh if you s\nUh it slides uh along ?\nUm slides I think .\nYeah , y Maybe , yeah .\nIt's\nFrom from the uh beneath ?\nFor the bottom .\nYou can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough .\nNo , you gotta slide it .\nIf that breaks then you're screwed .\nYeah , it's right .\nSo it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um\nSo what do we need ?\nUh i the the speech functions buttons .\nYeah , just\nMenu ?\nMenu button . With uh maybe uh arrows . So you can uh\nscroll in the , navigate the menu . Um\nGod damn it .\nScart ?\nI think we can even put a   We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels .\nUh yeah . And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes .\nSo you have one left for the  Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often .\nSo this is the\nYeah .\nIf you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day .\nIt's a f  basic uh\nYeah .\nExtern or something .\nYou want to save that file as well ? The drawing ?\nThat was it .\nSo here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many .\nUh\nDoesn't really matter . Just just uh\nIt doesn't really matter .\nI don't know the functions .\nThat's  Yeah well we don't have any uh\nOkay . What else ?\nHmm ?\nWhat else ?\nWhat else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows .\nUh menu .\nYeah , to navigate .\nS Just uh like\nUh  With arrows .\nUm I think it's best if we do . Mm where do we have  Or there .\nLike a normal um\nLike on the normal uh  Like this .\nYeah , with in the middle um a menu button .\nThe menu button , yes .\nOkay .\nWell we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it .\nMm okay .\nYeah .\nMaybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?\nYeah .\nYep .\nUh and and you can hold it ,\nyou can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons .\nYeah .\nJust press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?\nokay .\nOr we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . Just red , yel uh red , green and\nOkay , yeah . Th Yeah .\nYeah , okay .\nIf we have enough place , uh then we can do that .\nThat's that's very easy , yeah .\nWe can put those here .\nColour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or\nYeah .\nYep .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nOkay . That's uh  Um\nSo did we miss anything ?\nYeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume .\nIt  Some text uh buttons .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah , but\nNo , ma on on o on the on the\nI just uh  The volume logo .\nthere's one there's one text button I\nOh wh Here ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nJust make it\nOkay . Yeah , or th or the\nThere's one text button I prefer . That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text .\nYeah , we have that on the the text button .\nYeah .\nDo you do you\nYep .\nDid you think of that ?\nYeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then\nUh why not ?\nYeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well .\nEx Yeah . Yeah .\nNo  Whoa\nWell w we thought of a text button . And if you press it again , you get the the the\nI think um\nThe sta the state you\nOh just three stages , you\nthrough view .\nYeah , that's okay .\nYeah , the three stages . Yes .\nYeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off .\nYeah .\nSo you can switch back from second to w first .\nNo , it doesn't have to turn it off . Just don't\nNo . Just remember where it was .\nYeah .\nIt it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ?\nYes , that's to remember .\nOkay , okay .\nYeah , but that's that's uh\nBut maybe it's not the way\nI dunno if\nThat's a functionality for the television .\nYeah , I think as well , but  Uh yeah .\nMm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .\nYeah mm nee uh  No , if i  uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on .\nYeah , in thi the the remote control in the\nOkay . Yeah , but you have to search every time again .\nthe chip .\nTh i\nThat's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that .\nYeah , that's true .\nYeah , I dunno . Okay .\nSo yeah . Um do we need to fix that or\nNo , that's what the television does .\nMm  most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .\nYeah , those memory functions .\nBut uh not not every every television , so\nYeah .\nOkay , it's cool .\nWas uh this logo for uh volume ?\nYeah , that's fine .\nOkay . So that's it ?\nIs this prich pretty much it , yeah ?\nYeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ?\nMm . No no\nJust like your telephone , hard plastic .\nYeah . Just hard plastic . So\nOkay .\nIt's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .\nBecause um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh  And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?\nI think just on the buttons .\nUh I think just um\nIf you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space .\nWell yeah . That's too much place .\nI don't think the space is worth it .\nYeah , but\nOkay , just leave it . Just leave it .\nI think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .\nYeah , and i The most time  Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay .  Okay . Fine .\nYeah ? Okay , cool . Mm mm mm mm mm . Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one .\nYeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model .\nOh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool . Okay .\nI d d d I don't think if it's right .  That shall show it .\nYou have some usability criteria or\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nUh no , uh all criterias we just argue about .

And   The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our\nOkay .\num  model .\nOkay .\nAnd this  These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um  we have to discuss about  , if we give it a one or a seven .\nUh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful .\nUh\nIt's\nYes .\nWe are actu We are the\nMm .\nYeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and  and that kind of stuff .\nFlashy .\nOkay . Well I think we do\nThe LEDs .\nIf it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .\nYes .\nBut uh\nAnd and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ?\nYeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste .\nHmm ?\nThe basic colours are black or green or yellow ?\nUm basic colours ,\nOr you haven't thought about\num yeah . Well you didn't say .\nHo how do we make uh\nMaybe um company colours ?\nIt's black .\nBlack .\nBlack and yellow .\nYeah , yellow light .\nA bit a bit of yellow .\nCan\nDo we have yellow light ? No , not really , but it's possible .\nNot not not yellow  , but just a bit of light yellow .\nIt's\nBlack white , maybe ?\nLike white , also ni or uh always nice .\nAnd what colours should the buttons be ?\nUh  Because um\nYeah , different colours . This is\nJust um\nOh , the same as th th the cover . But also th the light behind it .\nYes .\nBut can you change those too , with uh the switch ?\nNo , no . Make them  No , just make them black or grey or something .\nYeah , grey . Just dark grey I think .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours .\nWell we have changeable fronts , so\nChangeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful .\nSo\nYeah , just give it a one . It's okay .\nYeah .\nIt's perfect . I think it's just what you want . Or not ?\nIt's hard to decide for us , but yeah .\nYeah . It's ju so subjective .\nIt it's  At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls .\nOkay , just give it a two .\nYeah . A two . Okay . The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons .\nYeah .\nOkay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think .\nYeah .\nOne more thing .\nSo\nAre w are we changing uh  Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ?\nSlide panel ?\nYeah ?\nNo . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers\nMm . Not needed  .\nand uh\nYeah , not needed I think .\nAnd and the switch channel is uh  There is a back light too ?\nThat as well , yeah .\nOh , you mean th this here ?\nYeah .\nYeah , but that's unnecessary .\nYeah .\nWhat do I think is necessary necessary item ?\nIt's pretty cool . If you slide it open ,  it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but  I don't know if it's reachable .\nYeah .\nOf course it's reachable .\nIt doesn't make\nThen we do it .\nOkay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up .\nHmm .\nSo you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something .\nNo . Yeah .\nJust a green light or some blue light . To light it all up .\nYeah ,\nBut  Yeah . Mayb Okay .\nbut\nYeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons .\nYeah .\nAnd th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . So the buttons are just grey .\nWell yeah . Uh semi-transparent .\nOkay .\nYeah , just only  Yeah , that's right .\nOkay .\nOkay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy .\nSo  Yeah , that's how I think .\nYeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so\nSo I'll give it a\nYe\nYeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so\nYeah , this  It is a one .\nYeah .\nIt's okay . It's cool .\nI think it's one . Okay , next .\nThis is a difficult one , because we we don't  Yeah , we don't know it about the\nLearnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it  But uh\nUh  it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .\nYeah .\nIt's  That's\nNo , but you don't have to use that .\nYeah .\nAnd you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .\nNo .\nThat's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .\nSo I think it's easy to use , but  And learnable is a bit\nLearnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .\nWell , I think it is .\nBecause because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .\nWell y just uh f\nI think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or\nBut the rest of it is very easy ,\nUh then the re\nbecause there are so so n\nYeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .\nSo so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .\nYes .\nYeah .\nBut the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .\nOkay .\nSo it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use .\nOkay .\nIt's  Yeah it's\nBut\nAnd I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .\nYeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ?\nDevice .\nAnd maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls .\nBut  yeah .\n'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um  easy to use .\nOkay .\nBecause easy to use comes after learnable .\nOkay , just  Easy to use is very cool ,\nI I think it a three or something .\nso just give it a two .\nMaybe three then . Learnable's\nNo , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .\nMm uh . The normal .\nYeah okay . Yeah .\nAnd the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know\nYep , true . Then a two .\nOh . Okay .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nNew features . Techno technological innovative ?\nThe speech function and the colour . Colour .\nThe speech function is new .\nAnd the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .\nThe scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new .\nSlide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a\nUh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .\nUh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it .\nOkay .\nSo that's not new .\nBut also slide that buttons come out , as well ?\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay , and the the the lightning ?\nThat's cool .\nIs that new ?\nYeah for a  Uh for a f\nThe lighting's new .\nYes .\nMm it's pretty new , I think .\nScrollwheel . Speech ?\nSpeech is new .\nDifferent colours , so\nYeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo we have a pretty new uh\nThere are no games on it , that's that's  It's not a one , it's a two again .\nThat would  And we didn't uh\nIt's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something .\nBut then we also have the the home station .\nIf you have\nWe are forgetting about that now , but\nYeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable .\nUh-oh .\nWe don't\nHome-station .\nrecharge .\nYeah , we didn't draw that too , but\nBut that's more like uh now .\nYeah , just draw it afterwards .\nYeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing .\nI don't know .\nIf you  Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ?\nUh  Just save , save as ?\nYeah . Mm-hmm . Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project .\nWell it's a already in the folder . L like number seven .\nOh yeah , okay . Smart board .\nYeah .\nYeah , but this one .\nOkay .\nThis one is not yet in the  Oh oh .\nI think it is .\nYeah , it is .\nNo , I think it is .\nUh untitled ?\nYeah , it doesn't matter . Save .\nOkay .\nBut you still have to draw the resi the recharger .\nUh all  the the seven , uh all the seven .\nOkay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . But not\nNo , we are not extraordinary new or something .\nNo , just so it's still a two .\nN\nMm two , I think .\nTha tha that\nTargeted audience . Uh we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ?\nNo , we we we searched for uh um  a young group , audience , beneath f forty .\nYeah , but l younger than forty . So we we are exactly the targeted group .\nYes . Yeah , but did we reach , um  with our uh style , the targeted audience ?\nI think so , yeah .\nTh that's my question .\nYou get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people .\nYeah .\nSo you want\nWe've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So\nYeah . Yeah .\nthink that's a two or a one .\nUm the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh   That's  that's   That's this question .\nYeah , but s it  That's basically not not handy . And  I don't thi I don't see\nYeah , this .\nYeah .\nSo we targeted it ? But we didn't follow the latest trends .\nYeah .  No . Yeah , you could make a a front\nMm . I think we followed the latest trends .\na front that's that's like uh like a banana ,  or something .\nTha these are the only latest uh trends I uh  get on my computer .\nOh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah .\nYeah , you get different colours .\nYou can different front uh\nUh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh\nSo\nLike a a f banana kind of front .\nOh yeah . But spongy will never be .\nNo .\nSo we give ourself a three or something .\nYeah .\nOh .\nOkay .\nSo that's eleven .\nThat's uh\nIt's\nWhat's the average ?\nEleven divided by six .\nYeah , it is one point eight three .\nA perfect score .  No , I don't know .\nWe're not too hard on ourselves .\nThis is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up .\nOkay . Okay .\nAnd and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep .\nTo call .\nOh yeah , that's still\nUm\nCall\nYeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep .\nYeah , maybe we have to skip that one .\nOkay . No no , I want that in .\nThat's  Yeah , but it\nBut we can we can do it uh underneath the logo .\nNo , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable .\nIf you do uh\nOkay .\nYeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ?\nYeah , okay .\nIt's  uh\nSo I just got a financial um\nYes uh .\nYou s  saved it or\nYeah . I did save it .\nNo . Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me . It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros .\nMm  okay .\nThat's fine .\nBut uh is uh uh\nSo this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker .\nOkay .\nSo that's both .\nCome on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three .\nYeah , and single curved curved .\nBut but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or\nNo , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be  .\nCan we make that for uh h twenty cents ?\nYeah , we can uh\nProbably . I just  The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was  I'm not sure .\nUm  different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah .\nSee it's  I think it's okay like this .\nSpecial form , yeah .\nIt's hard to say . But maybe we have to um  Yeah ,  okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal .\nYeah .\nWe get different ones , that's all . So you can put a recharger in it as well .\nBut this is expensive , the sample speaker .\nYeah .\nThis ?\nYeah .\nYeah , it's four .\nFour . It's four Euros .\nOh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or\nYeah .\nYeah , that's included .\nSo we are\nOkay , then we then we need to use it .\nIt's kind of weird that we  we get this information now , afterwards . Because\nYeah , no .\nYeah .\nOkay , so this is uh pretty much it this  .\nDamn , solar cells are uh expensive .\nSo  I just want you  Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together .\nOkay .\nOkay . We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ?\nSure .\nYes .\nOkay .\nPaul , was there room for crea creativity ?\nBeautiful .\nMm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh  already . So\nYeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity\nYeah .\nOr a different style .\nthen there  we probably have been creative .\nI think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So\nYeah .\nYeah . We could make a lot of different uh remote controls .\nYeah .\nSo it's creativity .\nHuh .\nOkay , so the leadership  Was there a leadership and\nOf course there was .\nOkay .\nWhat do you have to say about that ?\nNo , I think\nWho was the leader ?\nI dunno .\nYeah .  Just normal discussion , I think . Not\nYeah .\none leader or something .\nOne leader to check the time , etcetera .\nYeah .

Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate .\nYeah .\nPrecise .\nAnd uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting .\nYeah .\nNot just pointing out on it .\nIt's the same for the presenta for the presentations . You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there .\nYeah .\nAnd so you've\nYeah , and p just point with a mouse .\nNo use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nJust old fashioned kinda blackboard style .\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nBut you might as well do it in normal computer style .\nlike  .\nYeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style .\nYeah . Yeah . And it's far too slow this way .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYou cou You could draw on it , but not as main function .\nNo .\nI think  Yeah , okay .\nDigital pen .\nSo we made it in time .

New ideas .\nYeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and\nYeah . But it's for the next team . We don't have to do that .\nYeah , but it  You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think .\nThat's for  . Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the\nYeah , just brainstorming basically .\nYeah . Details uh\nSo are we finished ?\nHmm .\nYes , I think just  I just write a final report .\nQuite early .\nOkay . Yeah .\nNo , we have only four minutes left . Uh it's okay .\nOh okay .\nOh , what do we have to do now . Do we uh  I thought we were done at four o'clock ?\nIt's now quarter past three .

So , today we are going to have a f second meeting . Oh Michael , hi .\nYep .\nYou're late . You have a good reason for that ?\nYes .\nVery good  .  Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today .  So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to  through the minutes of previous meeting . So uh  basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for  about that topics . I goin I'm going to share with you .  And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . You showed us\nYep .\nyou ar you you prepare something for us ?\nYeah . Yep .\nThe U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs .\nMm .\nAlright  so  so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of  to give a name to the project . So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should  we could discuss quickly . Any ideas ?\nUh the Powerstick .\nMm-hmm .\nPowerstick , yeah .\nWhat else ? What else ?\nUh .\nMaybe a Spanish name would work well .\nMm I was thinking of the\nEspecially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish .\nMando .\nMando .\nMango ? Mango ?\nWhat is that ?\nMando .\nMando . M_A_ ? M_A_ ?\nA*_N_ yeah D_O .\nM_ D_O_ . Mm , okay .\nIt doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me ,\nWhat does it mean ? Oh .\nbut maybe for a Spanish  for I  for\nWhat does it mean in Spanish ?\nControl .\nControl .\nHmm . Nice .\nOkay . 'Cause it also  like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote\nBut  mm , yeah .\nso it might\nMando sounds Latino .\nOkay .\nThe Mando .\nSo , let's go for Mando ? Yeah ? No objection ?\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah that's  .\nGreat . So\nAnd we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like\nOkay , I think this is\nAlthough you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though ,\nOkay .\ndo you ? So\nYeah they are the most T_V_ watcher . So we should be careful .\nYeah .\nOkay , I think this is more a question of of\nMarketing .\nBut  yeah\nI I think this is more a question of of look and feel .\nit uh\nSomething that should be addressed later We should we should go to other  for the other topics .\nYeah because if the product will be international\nWell that's the thing . We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a\nYeah okay , so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name\nUm .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, presentations, discuss, design, topics", "dialogue_id": 83}, {"text": "and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . So let's go for the three presentations right now . So , who want to start ?\nSo maybe we could start with the market , yeah .\nMaybe maybe I should uh start . Yeah . Mm . Okay .\nOkay so I have your slides somewhere ?\nYeah . Should be in participant four .\nParticipant four .  This one ?\nYeah , yeah .  Uh .\nS that's coming . Uh\nYeah .\nokay . Great .\nYep .\nOkay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting .\nMm-hmm .\nFor the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . And also I di I did a study with  for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been  have remained the same for the last five , ten years . There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and\nOkay . Sh next slide ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nOkay .\nWell   more  most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . Also the people are worried about about the R*_S_I_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a  with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . They are also   they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to  any beep any alarm or something incorporated to  with the remote control every time it it get lost .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd also I found that young people  the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .\nOkay .\nSo   in my opinion the Mando  this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like  the the liklier it is to get lost . Liklier or more likely ?\nMore likely .\nlikely . Okay . Uh  people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but  they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . So it may be interesting to to think in a  in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .\nWell th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe\nYeah .\ncut out some  a lot of your market .\nI dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some  a a small fraction of of this remote controls .\nWell maybe it could be a universal design .\nSorry ?\nA universal design , which is which is good for both the hands .\nStill shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ?\nYeah .\nYeah ? That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand ,\nYeah .\nbut but  don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?\nSorry ?\nThe first and the third point , they are clashing .\nWell it can still be a  , you can still extend past the hand .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nUh .\nLike uh\nSo fitting the hand doesn't mean much then .\nWell it means  like , this remote here is kind of  is very thin and long so instead of having  you know you might have it kind of  a bit bigger\nMm-hmm mm-hmm .\nYeah , like\nor , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something .\nMm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nSo it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ?\nLittle sleek , longer ?\nAnd it should fit the hand .\nNo no I was thinking of so like something\nSomething with the shape of the palm ?\nMm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nyeah .\nSome finger grips maybe .\nYeah .\nYou could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything ,\nOn the sides .\nYeah yeah . It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical .\nbut\nMm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nNot anymore . That's what  yeah .\nAnd then finally\nAnd finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget would be large enough .\nYeah .\nYeah . First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff because uh because\nBut most of  yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .\nYeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh  to bring you to some new uh new informations . We had the new requirements from the  so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted  so they want to um  they would like to be restricted to T_V_ .\nYeah .\nOkay , I dunno if you had this information already . No ,\nNo .\nso they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations . Um they want also uh\nActually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls .\nExcellent . So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally ,  it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .

Sure sure .\nbut um yeah .\nSo maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now .\nYep . Okay .\nOkay so let's keep in mind about tha that that  this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco\nYeah . I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think  if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the\nSorry , what is your  ?\nUh participant three . You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so .\nYeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so  yeah yeah .\nOh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_  sound turns off .\nYeah uh channel fifty .\nNo it could be command control kind of thing .\nYeah .\nIt requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . Means you say  you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition .\nYeah .\nBecause this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also .\nYeah .\nSo there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop .\nMm . Yeah .\nIt's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly .\nOtherwise it's just lying idle .\nOkay Michael .\nOkay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe  be easier to\nSorry ?\ncould I use the mouse , or\nUm yeah .\nMm . Thanks . Okay .\nThe wheel doesn't work .\nGreat  .\nOkay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really  it's by no means uh mm you know  on it's own in being so expensive . There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there .\nLooks like a P_D_A_  ?\nSo   yeah it doe it's  well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions  d different functions on the screen at different times . But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , which I think is  it's a really kind of important design aspect um is  it's  'Cause the thing is what a  what we  the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel .\nChange the channels .\nNow um\nYeah .\nuh the  I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . I usually use the up and down\nMmm-hmm mm-hmm . Yeah yeah .\nbecause most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just uh  it's annoying . So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability .\nMm-hmm .\nOne possibility , if we  now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . So if you think about  it's kind of like a  you know in mobile phones now you don't use  you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it .\nSo this would be pretty  kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price . So , I mean there are  there are uh cheaper  this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . And  was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want .\nBut there is one problem  then the user has to understand each of that functionality .\nSo\nMm-hmm .\nYeah well we w\nBecause the same button is doing too many things .\nYeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um\nMm-hmm .\nI I would  if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way .\nMm-hmm .\nThey don't really do anything . Maybe you know I  although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . Um\nH I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the  see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to  very different build  very different to the traditional\nIt does sampling out of the  .\nWell I guess that depends on how you market it . If you  if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .\nIf y\nOkay , can you continue , please Mi ?\nSo , but\nyep . Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this  a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh  something that would be worth implementing . Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . I think even that ,\nI mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement ,\nMm-hmm .\num but I think that would be quite useful as well . And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one  maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of  you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's  extensible to do other tasks . Say you have like um  a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you  also , selling the potential of the device . Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as  at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "presentations, remotes, speech, presentation, remote", "dialogue_id": 83}, {"text": "Okay .  Okay . Okay , thanks .   you want to go ?\nYep . So  yeah .\nSo most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own I\nThis one ?\nyeah , it should be .\nGreat . No , not that one .  you are two .\nTwo .\nAlright .\nOkay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing  doing some he is knowing about that technology . So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being  sitting on the on the remote . So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .\nOkay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .\nThat's right . So anyway , that didn't come into my mind ,\nOkay .\nso th that is a possibility . These could be other kind of interfaces .\nMeans we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . So spe buttons are something which is very  everybody is familiar with . So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is ,\nMm-hmm .\nand on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking . Otherwise we are just like others in the market . So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .\nYeah . That increases the the cost also .\nUh that's right . But uh means we have to see how much  what kind of microphones and stuff like that .\nDo you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well  of such technologies is enough ?\nUh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough .\nOkay .\nYeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc\nWell wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones\nHmm .\nbecause you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control .\nThat's right . No it it could be little d yeah it could be\nSo it could be s a few centimetres .\nWell one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,\nThat's right . That's right .\nbecause , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries .\nYeah .\nSo then you have to s you know , you have to train models for\nMm-hmm mm-hmm . Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and  it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller .\nYeah .\nOkay . Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide .\nYeah , that's right . Yeah .\nThis is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion .\nSo we can That's right . Yep .\nOkay , next . Uh that finished ?\nYep .\nNo ?\nNo no . Components .\nComponents ?\nYeah . So , will you go to the next slide ?\nYes sure .\nYeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . We are having a power button and the switch  , which is not much ,\nand then we are having the  which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . And then there are two kind of things which can be  so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time  .\nSo we could not put that . So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .\nOkay .\nSo this is the easiest design the there could be . So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in  . To have different technologies . So this was the  my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control .\nYou know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know  turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button\nYeah .\nlike uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing\nYeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nSo these are the slight problems .\nSo your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?\nBecause  yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means  though I don't have much idea , but as he  the uh Marketing Expert presentation was\nI'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo  everyone will s will buy it .\nActually I'm not so sure\nSo if we go with just the\nbecause I'm the\nI'm sure .\nyou know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm  instead of pressing up on on a remote control . You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said ,\nYeah .\nso maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .\nOkay so\nYeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about\nWell it depends if it's a remote control th\nit's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that .\nMaybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion .\nIf you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be  .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nOkay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now .\nAlright .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "remote, functionality, interface, buttons, technology", "dialogue_id": 83}, {"text": "Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said . We are targeting T_V_ .  We need  we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . Um we have\nWith a good shape for the\nor good shape , yes . We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . Maybe this is something we can stick to it . And um  also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the  one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_  and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_  in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback  to to give some feedback informations about what we could have .\nWell it depends though  well it depends . If we we don't  unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of  something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . So that's an extra\nYeah that's right . Don don't you ha\ncost .\ndon't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or  well systems that exist that we can use ?\nWell this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote . Are we still  you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?\nYeah .\n'Cause that really makes a big difference . 'Cause  even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . It's it's not really gonna\nYeah . That's good point . What's what cou what could be the cost of uh  well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?\nFor twenty five Euro ?  I think it's impossible .\nYeah .\nIt's not possible . It's impossible .\nBut but I dunno ,\nYeah .\nI think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that  any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh\nUh\nof increasing the unit price .\nSo you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is  which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um  in terms to had  to have really an added value ?\nWhat would be\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah\nOkay ,\nbecause  yeah .\nso regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is\nWha but what would be  one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?\nWell th\nWhat what kind of information ?\n'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .\nYeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the\nThey have tele teletext . Well , because they have teletext on it .\nthe n\nTh th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel .\nYeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays .\nThey have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid  well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet .\nYeah .\nSo to to uh\nYou can get a lot more information on it .\nto browse more easily the teletext . For instance through uh through your remote control .\nSo what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ?\nSo you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to .\nThe ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have uh  o\nYou could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something\nOkay .\nso you can quickly just kind of  even without reading\nWell I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also .\nWell no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . They may not have pictures , but maybe they do .\nAre\nThere's  dependi it also depends on the country .\nWell because   for the same reason that we cannot uh  informations on the T_V_  . We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there .\nNo but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh .\nSo  so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to\nBut  Yeah .\nWell I I think if we're gonna  I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ .\nI dunno . We need to find that out .\nOkay .  We need to close the meeting . Um  so\nBut  just a small thing ,\nVery quickly .\nwhat kind of market we are targeting ? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or  because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself .\nNo .\nThat is very important .\nMm .\nYeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their  ,\nIf it's a really small T_V_ maybe  .\nBroke . Okay . Okay .\nand they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have .\nOkay . Okay . Okay . Okay .\nSo this is  that we z that that we should target . So the com the um  the uh  the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion .\nMm-hmm .\nIt is up to you to go through this um  uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . So\nI think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the  than the L_C_D_ .\nIt's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ .\nYeah , but not sure . Maybe it's cheaper , but we have no\nBecause with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . You need a internet connection . You need m more things .\nBut\nWell the thing is I think I think the type of peop\nfor the speech recognition you you don't need anything . You just say channel fifty , and that's it .\nI think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a  you know .\nBut then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars ,\nMeans th yeah twenty five Euros is  yeah , that's right .\nWell this is what we need to find out .\nit's\nCan we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 'Cause otherwise we need\nOkay this is   this is an open question for you . Yeah . This is uh up to you to tell us . But I'm definitely not keen on to to\nTo move to another target ?\nno no no , I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . I'm not confident enough . I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work . I uh that work\nIt's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna\nIt's real yeah . How to guarantee such performances is really hard .\nthe expert uh said ninety five percent  .\nWell this is still  is is very bad .\nNinety five percent is not good enough though .\nSo , this is the end of this discussion . Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . Um  so you have to work on the component uh concept .\nOkay .\nUh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . Okay . So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing . Um uh we  I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction . Thanks .

Um  which was we got together just to basically decide on  well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing ,\nand who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on .  Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before ,\nMm-hmm .\nsee I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations ,\nwhether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .\nHmm .  Do you have any preference uh of order ?\nUm I'd like to um hear\no I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want  what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and\nBatteries .\nI think she is still finishing her  .\nNo no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing .\nIt's just that  yeah , let's let's hear from you first .\nOkay .\nHmm .\nWhere is that thing ?\nOkay , it's uh\nIt's here .\nOh sorry , couldn't see .\nWould that work ?\nGet yourself in position .\nOkay , so that's me again .\nAh .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, talk, preparing, madonna, cover", "dialogue_id": 84}, {"text": "Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is  which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of  which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v\nI don't think any of us remember the fifties .\nIs it like a crank thing or something  .\nyeah , yeah . It wouldn't be very fancy .\nYou can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that  it will give it the energy to work .\nMm .\nOr you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but\nWell , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with  but also using some solar power .\nYeah .\nDo  sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ?\nMm .\nDoes anybody know ?\nI dunno actually .\nUh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know .\nI dunno . Um . Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .\nOkay .\nAnd uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice ,\nMm .\nbut I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that .\nMm . Okay , jolly good .\nFor the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so\nWhat's a double curved one ?\nYou know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .\nOkay .\nSo   Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where  for example titanium , you can't use it for  if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh\nSo that might be an idea of using the rubber ,\nYeah .\nbut then it should , you know\nLet's have a squeezable remote .\nyeah .\nYeah . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe ,\nwhen a T_V_ programme's got one\nI dunno\nwatching the match and  your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you .\nYeah .\nYeah , I like that idea .\nMm .\nSo rubber would be  Okay .\nI think rubber's\nRubber , we're all we're all going  we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ?\nBut after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more\nOoh , we like rubber , ooh .\nUh s so if d\nPeople .\nokay . And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . Um scroll buttons , as well .\nUh-huh .\nSo if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .\nWell , we're gonna go with  I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so\nSo it's a constraint . Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ?  If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . If that makes sense .\npush buttons instead of the wheel ?\nYeah .  .\nIf it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway ,  it doesn't matter if it's double  I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double  rubber double curved case ?\nrubble double double .\nNo , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing ,\nI'll have a Big Mac , please .\nthen you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's   we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it  if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go  I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . So , either\nOkay .\nI dunno we just need to decide on the on the case .\nLet's have rubber push buttons , hey .\nOkay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way .\nLet's go crazy .  And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be  so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons .\nYeah .\nUm and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .\nSimple , yeah . Chip on print . It's a bit  .  Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here\nMm .\nis uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?\n. Yeah .\nThe infra-red . Yeah .\nRight . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ?  Y um  what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?\nWell , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm\nso it sounds\nTechnically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too .\nSo , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit .  I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not .\nFo It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . Totally . Yeah .\nUm we wanna go for an i i all\nSo let's not go for the\nso long as it works ,\nYeah , yeah . I agree .\nyou know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .\nSo it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .\nYeah . S yeah , push buttons .\nWhat about the just developed uh sample sensor ?\nI think push-buttons is\nWhat about what ?\nG there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .\nWell\nWell , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?\nMm , I dunno . Be cool .\nIt'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it ,\nYeah .\nChannel two .\nI'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and\nS\nTh the the  speech recognition um option is  it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh ,\nYeah . It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product .\n'cause uh  The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um  That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever .\nYeah .\nBut , I mean , it's not\nHm .\nit would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns  comes on , but it's not that . It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response .\nOh , it just gives an answer .\nSo , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ?\nOh , then then\nYeah . Yeah .\nJust if you are really lonely , maybe .\nI thought I thought it was  when they said\nYeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's\nI thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like ,\nChannel five . And then it switches on .\nchannel five , and it will change .\nNo , tha that w that w that would be more promising .\nLike you talk to it . Can I have channel five ?\nYeah .\nIt it's just a remote that talks to you .\nYeah . Yeah .\nUh .  I mean to certain cues .\nOh , then  forget about it . Oh right okay .\nYeah .\nOkay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the\n'Kay . Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery .\nBasic battery .\nMm .\nIt's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work .\nHmm .\nCheaper option . Are you happy with that ?\nMm . Yeah .\nOkay . So we'll go for the battery . Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?\nWe were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ?\nYeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved .\nThe the\nSo it will look like something like this .\nDouble ?\nThe double whopper , please .\nOkay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons ,\nYep , but  we're going for the simple buttons .\nSo rubber rubber keys , yeah .\nYeah .\nand that's fine ?\nAnd it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it\nP\nYeah .\nas i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_  people were getting the  complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ .\n.\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo that's another marketing point that we can use .\nWell the rubber push-buttons  . Don't you have to move your\nBut anything is gonna have buttons .\nMm .\nEven if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . You\nI thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a\nYou see , you can still get  it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen .\nThat they don't .\nIt's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same  doing the same movement .\nMm .\n.\nIt's not actually what you are doing .\nBut the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific\nMm .\nYeah .\nYeah , the rubber's good .\nWe're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , so they can sit there and go like\nNot that watching T_V_ should be that stressful .\nAnd you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children  yeah .\nOh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports .\nAlright , that's me done .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "solar, energy, battery, power, light", "dialogue_id": 84}, {"text": "Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's  the interface .\nAlright . Alright . Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about .\nGreat .\nSorry .\nOkay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out .\nMm .\nUh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface .\nI guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless .\nMm .\nUh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh  they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod .\nMm .\nMm .\nUm so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing .\nYeah .\nMm .\nUm the other suggestion ,\nThat does get annoying .\nand I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have  lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or  ,\nMm-hmm .\nor uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .\nYeah .\nUh  um  So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button  in our last  I can give you an example here of uh ,  good layout and bad layout\nuh from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh\nYeah . Yeah .\nit's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose .\nDo we have an uh example of a good one ?   Brilliant .\nUh-huh . Well\nAnd for  something for kids . Yeah . Um .\nYeah .\nAnd so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of  we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general .\nMm-hmm .\nI didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me .\nOkay . Well let's um  so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The um  The the um the interface type we're going for\nSo we're  we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh .\nJust the simple s simple straight set of buttons .\nSo , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um . I think we shall have a limited number of buttons ,\nYeah .\nideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .\nYeah .\nUh . And some sort of  it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .\nYeah .\nI guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that .\nOkay , and we're not  yeah .\nWell now that we've decided on our\nAre we gonna hav hav  an  are we d\nhave we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something\nUm it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy ,\nWe're\nMaybe we can\nbut um  Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that .\nYeah . Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey . Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . Let's move over to\nI I guess  the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .\nYeah , sure .\nI mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button .\n.\nBut I think that should be  I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating .\nYeah , the button that just does that , yeah .\nSo that should be simple .\nCool .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "interface, buttons, functionality, remote, components", "dialogue_id": 84}, {"text": "Right . Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets\nMm yeah .\nand what the fashions are for next year . Um . So yes  , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions\nMm-hmm .\nand also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market  these are like most important aspects like that we really need to\nwhich we've already probably discussed . Um  the most important aspect is look and feel . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already  that we already have . So it has to be\nYeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ?\nYep .\nMm .\nExactly .\nYeah .\nUm second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . So\nWhat's that mean ?\nTechnologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work .\nWell it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense ,\nShould\nI mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market .\nThat's new .\nOkay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah . Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from ,\nYeah .\n'cause our rubber one is not fancy\nYeah .\nMm .\nI mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we  maybe we're going in the wrong direction . And it's it's not technologically innovative either .\nMaybe we could um\nSo ,  no loose\nMm .\nThat's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is  , like people  and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .\nOf course , they do .\nWell , they do , but it's like it's not\nOne hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not .\nYeah , but it looks good . If it looks good and it's  it can just be there for decoration .\nOkay , well , what do you two think about this ?\nSo is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other\nBut like\nYeah , what  I don't understand what m\nelectronics ?\nYou could always insert , yeah .\nYeah , that's basically what it allows you to do ,\nYeah ,\nright ?\nand it  this is just gonna   all this is being used for is your television .\nYeah , but , I mean , people like\nIt would  that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does ,\nWell , if you're looking at   if you  looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .\nWell\ndoes it ? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well .\nBluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect  for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . Things like that .\nNo , that would be your telephone  in with your television .\nNo i\nYeah , the  that wouldn't be the remote so much ,\nYeah ,\nI mean\nand i\nNo , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to\nNah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically .\nI with the television , yeah .  I was just trying to find an advantage . Wha what w what advantage would you get for the\nMm .\nWell , it doesn't\nAn and there is no there is no such thing\nLike it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery  it could be something really really minor , you know , like  but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it .\nOkay .\nIf we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative .\nMaybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet .\nOkay .  Yeah , this  that's that's very good .\nAnd then you can market it . Never have to change a battery again .\nChange the batteries ever again .\nAnd and this is all tying in very nicely .\nThe fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .\nYeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much .\nYes , so can\nBut yeah , by the squeezing it the\nI think , safety s\nYeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating  like the energy generator .\nYeah , that's a great idea . Well done .\nYeah . Third most important aspect  uh is it's easy to use .\nwe're all about that .\nAnd I think we've all um worked that out . Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .  So next year people will be buying  , I found this really funny  , you know , strawberry shaped chairs ,\nOkay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI wanna watch the pineapple channel .\nRubber things .  Um  and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is\n.\nWell spongy , that's where  . Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .\nYeah , that's great for us .\nyeah , so we're in .\nYeah . And so personal  what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . So yeah .\nOkay .\n. I had to say\nRight .\nSo we're moving in the right direction like\nAlright , yeah , no , this i this is good ,\nYeah .\nso through all that we've  we go we're  right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing ,\nYep .\nYeah , that's great .\nthat's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can  as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries  ,\nMm .\nand um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .\nNo vegetables .\nYeah , I don't know how we incorporate\n.\nWe don't have to follow every trend , I guess .\nMaybe make it like fruity colours or something .\nUh-huh .\nSome sort . Or\nThe power button could be like a big apple or something .\nMm .\nWell yeah , but Apple would sue you for that .\nYeah , this is true  .\nThey don they don't own  all images of apples .\nsued the Beatles so\nOkay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate .\nWell , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be ,\n.\nor like are we going  yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ?\nWell   I think , if it's rubber it needs to be\nI mean you said earlier on i  it should be funky .\ndifferent . I think , it's  it should be  I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like\nL keep it clean , keep it clean .\nreally different colours basically .\nOkay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material  that material ?  Um\nUm like I'm just thinking bright colours .\nYeah .\nBright natural colours , nothing too\nBright , but not too bright .\nBright , but too  not  yeah .\nYeah .\nLike no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so  anybody can choo like like\nLike the volume buttons should be the  all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ?\nMm .\nYeah . And on the back of it have the logo .\nOkay , what  ?\nYeah .\nSure .\nWhy not ?\nOkay . Tha\nThe one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having\nYeah , I mean we  that's we we\nI mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote .\nYeah .\nThis is the remote control tomato .\nI mean  what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ?\nWell   I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . Like  and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one .\nAnd uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around .\nYeah .\nEspecially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and  Yeah . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but\nWell , it's it's gotta be chew proof .\nYeah .\nI'm gonna write that down .\nSo\nso it's rea it's quite\nit's quite like um user friendly\nand also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like  pink remote control for their room something .\nSo , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different\nYeah .\nso we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the\nThat's  yeah .\nMm .\nSo like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour  wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . So they also get to pick . Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour .\nYeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod ,\nIt's um\nwhere , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .\nMm .\nYeah . Mm .\nAlthough I'd be curious to see how many uh\nD you've got the\nYou know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour .\nWell that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know ,\nRight .\nif that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular .\nMm .\nYeah .\nAnd produce less of the silly colours , maybe .\nMm .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "innovative, remotes, technologically, remote, televi", "dialogue_id": 84}, {"text": "Okay .

Yeah .\nMm .\nYeah , we're definitely not in the money making department .\n.\nWell I I did notice looking at  I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable .\nYeah .\nI mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious .\nMm .\nR_R_ . Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's  doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black .\nMm .\nThat's true .\nAnd the spaceship doesn't have the R_   have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it\nNo .\nDoesn't\nbut  I still want one .\nMm .\nOkay .

Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . Looks cool . And then we're gonna evaluate it .\nBra\nThen we're gonna talk about finance , and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . And uh\nHmm you knocked it up ?\nyep . And  we're gonna evaluate the product and close .\nGot forty minutes to do this in . We should be fine . Let's try and keep this one on schedule .\nAlright .\nSo\nYour thing is in  where is it ? Is it in\nThree , three .\nThi third third third . The end product thingy . Yeah .\nWho wants it ?\nPedro can have it .\nI like\n.\nI'll help talk .\nUm yeah so what we ended up with . Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros ,\nsomeone forgot the  units there\nUnit price .\nyeah , uh unit price  unit production price cost thing . Um we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the  the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll .\nZapping your favourite channels , eh ?\nYeah .\nScrolling through your favourites list .\nOh okay okay .\nZapping you know zapping .\nAh 'kay okay , that's favourites .\nMaybe it's just a Portuguese thing  . And um yeah that was the result .\nAh 'kay . I like the the the the logo on there as well .\nIt's very prominent  .\nIt is very prominent . So this is the\nSo  here I'll give you the  so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . Um so the scroll bar is  or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here .\nOkay .\nUh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . This is the power button . Uh we have our um  we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? This is the teletext .\nStart s the the start uh to to to\nThe programme button ,\nprogramme yeah .\nAh , okay I see .\nyeah the programme button . So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming  your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . So um the plastic is the white area of this  of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering .\nIt's pretty cool .\nSo you can see that when it lays like this or like this  and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um\nIs that  could that be easy to  for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?\nYeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it\nNot helping  .\nyeah  .\nOh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it .\nYeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . You can feel it .\nMm . Feels good .\nI take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well .\nYeah of course . Well this is clay  .\nYeah it's kinda cool . You have to reach a little bit don't you .\nYeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit .\nAh yeah that wouldn't make sense .\nThese  this is a bit larger than it would be , but\nIt's cool . I'm impressed .\nDon't have no one to handle that .\nAnd hold it so\nMm that's\nwh what's the marketing perspective ?\noh that's  oh I like it . I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this . Yeah I think it's good . Good good good job .\nMm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability .\nYeah . So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote .\nBeep beep beep .\nUh pla\nThe locator function .\nI'm ha\nOkay .\nIt's great . That's great . It's a great feature .\nUm beep beep beep\nMm it's impressing .\nWicked isn't it ?\nSo let me get it ,\nso\nif I press this button\nbeep beep beep\nI see . That's pretty cool . Hang on .\nbeep beep beep  be shut up .\nSo you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town\nBeep beep beep\nI plan to do that as well .\nokay . Um no no no tha that's alri\nSo the the two blue  are are those for the the it to charge off of  in ?\nExactly that's exactly what those are for .\nAh okay okay .\nAnd um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um  you could\nbeep beep beep\nwe were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger\nYeah  it's the right shape isn't it ?\nit it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so\nBut maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling ,\nMm .\n'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides  .\nRight . So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit ,\nOkay .\nbut\nUh , I can see that .\nBut it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn't it ?\nMm-hmm .\nYep I like . Good job .\nSo is that the the final colour scheme as well or ?\nNo no .\nOh no this is  just what we had to work with at the time .\nOkay .\nSo we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .\nThe  hmm .\nCareful .\nIt came off . The scroll wheels ,  a problem with them not being sort of\nI don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore .\nWell I mean of course , I mean\nMy my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .\nMm .\nYou know some blend of silvers and blacks .\nBeep beep beep .\nOkay enough of that .\nWell i it's cool guys .

Okay .\nYeah yeah . So\nCan I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ?\nNo it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it .\nOh I see I see .\nI couldn't create it in the PowerPoint ,\nand I think I've got this really strange cable . So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ?\nNah .\nSo what we had is we had the method . That's not how you spell method , is it ?\nNo way .\nNo A_  .  .  So this doesn't go so fast this way . And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . And uh to me with this product we got uh  we got  basically three things to market . We've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the  I I don't know what we would call the other part  what we call you know the the  the corp corporate  Help me . The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . So the features I think  we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability ,\nIt fell off .\nwe've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um\nBeep beep beep .\nthe characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . Uh and the corporation , we're talking about  we're we're a new we're a new company . We're wanting to make a name for ourself . We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of  the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? That was something I would be interested in . Um so  yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . Um w\nDo you  would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?\nThat that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .\nMm-hmm . Mm 'kay .\nBut I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh  there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . But with all of these other features I think people c  one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my  but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back .\nAnd we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that .\nWell one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?\nHmm .\nYou know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after\nW we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm , but you follow what I'm s I'm s\nWe we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . But uh\nYeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're   yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea I had . Uh to me the only additions\nYeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less  b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works .\nYeah .\nMm there's a risk of that .\nYep .

So I have a little spreadsheet for us where  I I was wondering , you  when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ?\nWell , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units .\nOkay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this .  Now\nOh .\nVery co very colf colourful .\nI've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros ,\nUh-huh .\nequivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already .\nUh-huh .\nUh  and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nbeep beep beep .\nCan be made for  it sounded different that time  uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display ,\nOh , sorry .\nuh an uh    Uh do you think that's fair coming from a  m the manufacturing ?\nYeah um I do think we that we we  uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print ,\n.

I don't know whether that  .\nIt's single-curved ,\nYou think ? Okay\nyeah .\nI'm  convinced . But we save one Euro that way , yeah ?

It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ?\nUh no we just use it as a scroll .\nOoh .\nOkay then we have fifteen point eight Euros .\nIt was a pretty accurate estimate I would say .\nIt wasn't bad .\nYes .\nYeah  .\nWe're wicked .

Um of course we're a  not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use .  Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . And w uh  well um functional design um . Um do we have  um any ideas of of   maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .\nYeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just  you know , change channels is its main function .\nSo we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or  I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?\nOh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote\n'Kay .\nfor  could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .\nMm .\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nMm .\nI think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like  I don't actually know .  But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ?\nI I think  yeah , yeah , r universal remote .\nYe yeah .\nUm this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control ,\nHuh .\nso\nOurs too .\nI think we're all in the same boat here .  Um\nUm one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em .\nOkay .\nSo if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature .\nMm . Ch\nSo we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh\nLike a tracking device ?\nlike a tracking device or or like a a\nOh you can get those key  well you could whistle or make a noise\nIt makes a noise ,\nand it'd beep .\nthere's a button on the T_V_ that you press\nMm , mm .\nand\nYeah .\nMm .\nRight .\n'Kay .\nBe good .\nSo\nGenerally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance .\nYeah . Do we want\nJust long .\nso they're kinda like long and rectangular .\nYeah .\nDo we want something crazy ?\nBlack usually .\nYou know , we want something new that's gonna stand out .\nYeah .\nLot more modern .\nA m a modern  so our remote should be\nI think so . Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball .\nMaybe like user-friendly , like a little\nYeah .\nyou know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .\nPeople\nMm .\nI thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another  if it was in a ball ,\n'Kay .\nand maybe the actual controls are inside or something .\nMm .\nUm .\nWell there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time ,\nYeah .\nso there are always the  some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . What are we gonna build that thing out of ?\nMm .\nHow sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ?\nOkay so  yeah , so we want it to be sturdy ,\nYeah .\nwe want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe ,\nYeah .\nthen it\nIt could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside .\n'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um  So our form and our function . Um we want it to be um easy to find .  Um   What else  it  what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal . It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so .\nMm . Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .\n'Kay .\nThat's more on the research end , but  the marketing .\nSo marketing , you know , how  maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing  remote control out there .\nYeah .\nAnd maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences ,\n'Kay .\n'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting .\nYe Small .\nRight .\nUm   Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ? We want it to be a b a ball ,", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remotes, remote, design, programming, creating", "dialogue_id": 86}, {"text": "I'd  I could draw sorta the ball idea .\nyou know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located .\nMy original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you  this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle  Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that  if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts ,\nand then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just something  maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair .\nBut yeah .\nFuturistic .\nThat was that was a sorta simple idea I had\nUh-huh .\nand then you know you could  about  Right , it would almost be like a ball . So that was just just an idea I had . I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ?\nRight . One problem you'd get with this design is um  the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really ,\nYeah .\nbut of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere ,\nYeah . Maybe f yeah .\ntake away that part . That's one of the big issues . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem .\nYeah , that's g that's a good idea . Yeah . The idea  it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge ,\nThat's that's  interesting of course ,\nthat was just one idea though .\nbut that's of course a weak point , yeah .\nYeah .\nHow would we go about um making you know  getting rid of our weak points ? What  I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?\nNot to put you on the spot ,\nE No no ,\nbut\nuh uh  .\nWhat did you say your title was again ?\nN n\nYou're the the Industrial Designer .\nUh , I'm your Industrial Designer ,\nso i b well ,\nthe point is that  well maybe  I dunno . The shape is perhaps not the most ideal .\nOkay .\nAs as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so .\nWell I I suppose that things become  design . But I mean i\nMm-hmm .\nI was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote ,\nYeah .\nmaybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah .\nIt's not new , it's not innovative , it's  you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy ,\nYeah .\nit's it's stable um .\n'Kay , I'll draw something .\nSo if\nWhat ?\nno , go ahead .\nMy idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games\nYeah .\nl so . But maybe  I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know .  That's my idea .\nI think definitely doing something different\nYeah .\nis a good idea .\nMm .\nI mean maybe design something , that's sort of like  suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .\nSomething with a grip .\nMm . Yeah .\nYeah , with a grip .\nYeah . Because even  I suppose even with the ball\nIt still might be hard to\nit's\nit still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah .\nit might not be the easiest to hold onto um .\nMm .\nSo perhaps the the joystick  the the keyboard idea might work better .\nLike  yeah .\nBut then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we\nYeah .\nTrue .\nIt's d yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job .\nMm .\nI feel like I'm just shooting everything down here .\nThat's fine .\nUh  um\nYou're the boss , you're  allowed to .\nWell with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . So if the remote is too small it\nYeah .\nYeah .\nif it's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . So for that there's\nOkay , so\nSo\nunfortunately we've got about five minutes here  to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . Let's see here . What if we had what if we had not only um  say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way .\nYeah .\nCourse that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . So the grip is  No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then  flat uh  And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want .\nThe question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?\nMm , that's true .\nIt's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . So it's  don't make it too stable  uh .\nSo we don't have it flip open . We just have a ball\nBut then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then .\nTo the other design .\nOkay , so then we forget the ball .\nIt looks cool .\nLooks cool though .\nIt looks cool , but it's really not  it's not functional um .\nYeah .\nUh  functional .\nSo we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um  Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you  had there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way .\nYeah .\nCourse then it's it's like the rectangular  again , only with a couple of jutting out points .\nRight . Right .\nBut it's one-handed um .\nQuestion is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy ,\nYeah .\nright ,\nMm .\nmakes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll not  probably not get a get away from some longer design .\nYeah .\nRight .\n'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing .\nYeah ,\nYou know , all\nbecause it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do .\nthat dif batteries  right , and  Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back .\nIs it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? So that either way you're pointing it it would work .\nI suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .\nMore expensive and  yeah .\nCourse you can do that .\n'Kay . Um\nI mean of course it'll be evident after a while or  if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the  the buttons and stuff ,\nTrue .\nbut um it's rather about an instinctual thing ,\nPut it\nlike you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design of  or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work .\nEven if you designed it  in some  in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead ,\nYeah .\nand there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it .\n'Kay .\nUm\nSorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish .\nAre we out of time ?\nMm .\nYeah .\nOkay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some  Are good ideas , what are not .\nLet's .\nDoes it say  what does it say for n\nObviously\nit says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .\nUh . Must finish now , so .\nT\nAnd then marketing will look and see what uh what people want .\nMm .\nAlright .\nGreat .\nOkay . And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next  time around , be a little bit more prepared .\nAnd uh alright , good meeting .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "buttons, remotes, hinges, futuristic, remote", "dialogue_id": 86}, {"text": "Okay we all all set ? Right . Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . So um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . Anything I've missed ?\nNo .\nOkay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead .\nUh-oh . This is it ?\nNinja Homer , made in Japan .\nUm , there are a few changes we've made .\nOkay .\nUm , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside ,\nMm . Mm-hmm .\nso instead we've um  this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button .\nMm 'kay .\nUh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .\nAnd there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .\nWhere are they ?\nUm they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ?\nAh , right .\nOkay 'cause\nSo w what kind of thing uh is gonna be\nGreat .\nThe L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say\nRight . Okay .\nYou know it's like it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , whereas many  the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast .\nRight .\nMm-hmm . Okay cool .\nRight , 'kay .\nIt might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .\nOkay\nOh right okay .\nMm-hmm , and what is this here ?\nCool .\nThat's a number pad .\nOkay so the number pad is  'Kay , great .\nWhere are we gonna have the slogan ?\nUm they're al along this\nYou know , just like right inside there .\nYeah .\nOkay cool .\nYou have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom .\n'Cause slogans are usually quite small , right ,\nOkay .\nthey're not like huge\nMm .\nso they're s\nYep .\nSay a button's about\nOkay .\nLooks good .\nsay a button's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that .\nYep .  Mm-hmm .\nSo if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ?\nWell  we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger\nMm-hmm .\nso we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .\nOkay .\nYep so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres . Plus maybe half o five\nMm-hmm .\nsix seven eight ,\nAbout nine in total .\nSix , seven , eight , nine , ten .\nabout yeah nine total .\nSo we're talking about ten centimetres .\nThat sounds good . Yeah .\nThat would be good . So ten centimetres in height .\nYep .\nNine , ten . Yep .\nOkay um  .\nThat'd be good , in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be  that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there .\nYeah . That's great and it's very bright as well . So um okay .\nMm . Is it possible  uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . Is these are these the colours that  of production , or is this just what we had available ?\nWell I'm  We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .\nRight .\nOkay so just\nUm\ncould you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report .\nBut um  this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh  it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal .\nExcuse me .\nMm-hmm .\nUm apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen\nSure .\nOkay .\nand you use this as a jog-dial .\nOkay so that's like an okay button , right .\nMm-hmm .\nOh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ?\nI don't know .\nOkay .\nHow high is it ?\nNo as in the height , but what about the width ?\nYeah .\nOh oh\nDidn't put five centimetres .\nlike depth of the actual thing .\nDo we need five ? I don't think five is\nUm .\nbe about th three and a half .\nOkay .\nOh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay .\nSomething by there .\nYeah , yeah .\nSure .\nSo you can power on and off , what else can you do ?\nThree and a half .\nUm you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .\nOkay .\nUm , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume .\nOkay jog-dial for volume . And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?\nMm-hmm .\nUm you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and\nContrast , brightness ,\nUm yeah .\nyeah , and anything else ?\nUm just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , um we didn't actually go through and specify the\nWell of the designers what are they ?\nUh what can a T_V_ do ?\nOkay things like um brightness , contrast ,\nUh-huh .\num maybe tuning the channels .\nOkay channel tuning .\nUm .\nThat's a good one .\nWhat else ? Um the various inputs . Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having  you know which input do you have ?\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nOkay auxiliary inputs .\nMm-hmm ,\nUm .\nprobably colour or sharpness .\nYep , colour , sharpness . Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .\nSharpness . Okay what about uh sound settings\nMm-hmm .\n? Uh d can you change any of those at all ?\nAudio .\nAudio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .\nUm .\nUm .\nthe the balance hmm .\nYep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes ,\nOkay .\nand then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay ,\nMm 'kay .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "prototype, remote, programmed, buttons, design", "dialogue_id": 87}, {"text": "is there anything else at all it can do ?

Okay um right I g I guess that's it , so we can now um   We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all .\nMm-hmm .\nSo um for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?\nThe battery .\nDo we have kinetic as well ?\nNo .\nNo . Okay ,\nUm .\njust battery .\nWe need an\nAnd that's because of cost restraints is it ?\nYep .\nOkay\nYeah .\nYeah advanced chip .\num what about the electronics here ?\nWe need an advanced chip I think , yep .\nAdvanced chip .\nLet me just confirm that . Yes I think so . Yep .\nOkay um the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ?\nUm I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing .\nYeah .\nSo we want double-curved ?\nYep .\nOkay . Um .\nPlastic .\nIs there any rubber at all in the buttons or any\nI think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .\nOkay ,\nUm .\num and we wanted special colours didn't we ?\nYep .\nSo I'll have to put that  Oh no wait we  ho how many colours have we got there ?\nFor the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour .\nJust one colour , okay .\n'Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it .\nOkay so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?\nMm .\nYes . One and the L_C_ display .\nOkay and then buttons , we have what , two colours ?\nHow many\nUm we have um got some push buttons as well .\nOr even clear .\nWe've got push buttons as well .\nLike uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push\n'Kay .\nokay .\nSo I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber .\nUh-huh .\nI'm not sure if that counts but\nOkay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .\nOkay . Okay .\nOkay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again .\nFour .\nYou can see we're we're all very far beyond the\nSo w why are we arriving at the number four ? Where does the number four come from ?\n'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .\nOkay right ,\nSo we're just estimating that yeah it would be less .\nso we're writing down four .  Okay . How about these ? Are we wanting them in\nNo .\nno they're just\nYep .\nis everything gonna be plastic ?\nYep .\nOkay . So we're w w quite far over .\nNow we're gonna  something's gonna have to go . Um we're at sixteen point eight and\nUh how mm-hmm  how are we going to achieve this high-end product if\nWell we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro ,\nWe only have very sparse\nso let me see , what are we  I mean\nTwo point three ? Four point three no ?\noh yes sorry , four point three . My maths is all out .\nWell we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .\nYeah .\nHow much would that save us ?\nAnd then where is the\nHow much would that save us ?\nThat will only save you one .\nThat is one .\nThe other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together ,\nOne .\num because when you do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well ,\nMm-hmm .\nso the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to\nThat's fair enough , yeah .\nso when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nwhich I think is a technically doable thing so\nOkay so\nMm-hmm .\nSo w what's our reviewed suggestion ?\nMm-hmm .\nUm take away the L_C_ display ?\nYep . And the advanced chip goes away as well .\nMm-hmm .\nTo be replaced with a\nRegular chip .\nregular chip .\nYep . So what that means is that um\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd so we've got point three to get rid of . Um and we ha where are the four  the four push buttons are where exactly now ?\nThe twelve buttons that you see there  .\nTwelve buttons .\nThat's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so\nYeah .\nFunctionally you're gonna have to intercept  So four is a good estimate for\nDo you think ?\nYeah , so you can't actually cut   It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .\nLike is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons ,\nIt  It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .\nhow can it be something in between ?\nMm-hmm .\nMm . Okay\nMm-hmm .\nwell we have point three to get rid of somewhere .\nWe just report that it has to be over budget  ,\nMm .\nor the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .\nNo can do .\nYeah we could just go with um\nYeah w\nNormal coloured buttons .\nWell do you want colour differentiation here ?\nNo that's not the button we're talking about .\nUm\nThat's\nOh yeah sorry yeah then .\nthe buttons only refer to the pad so\nRight so\nShould we take that off uh ?\nAh .\nHey it's back to the original .\nThat's it .\nHmm .\nUm so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost .\nMm-hmm . Mm .\nOkay , ach that's a shame .  Um right , so take away that completely ? Ah . And now we're under budget . So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted .\nSo I reckon\nUm\nHow about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ?\nDoesn't say so .\nYeah . That's a freebie .\nReckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons .\nYeah .\nYeah that's a good idea . Just one ? Does that mean that one button has a special form or\nI think  there's just one button so\nYeah okay .\nhandy  .\nWell well there we go . So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now . So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing , which I think is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here . Um .\nWas the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ?\nWhat do you mean by profile ?\nSort of flat as possible .\nYeah .\nNo .\nYou see I envision it as being um quite deep\nYeah .\nsort of  deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .\nYeah that's what I was thinking , to\nWe didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ .\nSure , okay . Yeah alright yeah fair enough .\nOkay , just thought I'd ask .\nSo there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add ,\nMm-hmm .\nand you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height .\nRight okay .\nYeah .\nSo just to well to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?\nYeah .\nOkay and then so height-wise\nHmm .\nHow how tall do you envisage it being ? About that big ?\nTwo .\nYeah it works , yeah .\nAbout two centimetres , okay .\nTwo's not very high at all though .\nThis is about this is about two .\nMaybe a bit higher ?\nSlightly more than two , so\nYeah .\nSee , about that thick .\nOkay . Ach , that is\nMaybe closer to three even or two and a half .\nOkay .\nYeah . Okay we'll s we'll say two point five . Okay um so we have it within cost anyway . Um so yeah project evaluation is this point . Um .\nMm-hmm .\nRight uh . Okay so can we close that ? This is what it's  the final spec that it's gonna be . Someone is gonna have to\nMm-hmm .\nyeah that's fine that's fine .\nUm it's probably just  I dunno if it's worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that\nI think that's something that's very hard to catch ,\nYeah .\nso you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .\nSure , okay .\nThe the look and the colour is something which is cool ,\nYeah , alright .\nbut I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar\nOkay , sure .\nthen um  because when you put it on the shelf\nWhat about button shape ? Square buttons ?\nYeah button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning ,\nOkay .\n'cause I think positioning is  we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of\nYeah . Sure .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\npad .\nRight um . So at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us I guess .\nMm 'kay .\nUm , let me see uh", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "double, electronics, prototype, chip, devices", "dialogue_id": 87}, {"text": "Do you want me to d um   Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ?\nMaybe we should do the design evaluation first .\nYeah I wasn't really sure what that was\nOr\nYeah\nEvaluation .\n, yeah go for that first . I wasn't entirely sure what uh  who was supposed to be doing that ,\nOkay .\nbut y you go for it .\nSure . Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint ,\nOkay .\nI'll try and do it as quick as possible .\nOkay .\nUm , this is um  I'll just go over your head if that's okay .\nYeah .\nI don't think you need the power ,\nso\nWhat's that ?\nNo , that's okay that's okay .\nI don't need the PowerPoint ?\nNo , the power cord itself .\nOh  course ,\nYeah , so then you have a bit more freedom to\nyeah that's true . Let me get that . A bit more .\nOkay ,\nYou you still have your blue fingers .\nso what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a\nIs it ?\nYou killed a monster .\nThe idea is that I've set up  I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that . Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but  Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ?\nOh there it is .\nYeah , okay great . Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um  sort of review where we stand with it . Okay , so um  So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low ,\nMm 'kay .\nokay . So these i these i th are the  and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement .\nOkay .\nOkay ? So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .\nI rate that pretty highly .\nWell yeah , I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI dunno like a six or something .\nYeah .\nWhat does anybody else think ?\nYeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour ,\nMm .\nand I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit .\nMm .\nBut\nOkay .\nI'm seeing five then .\nWhat do you guys think ?\nI would say five or six .\nOkay .\nYep I'm fine with that .\nDavid ?\nOkay let's go with five then .\nOkay .\nFi oh uh just actually the opposite .\nIt's one to seven , right ?\nOh yes\nThe\nsorry then", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "power, powerpoint, evaluation, design, plug", "dialogue_id": 87}, {"text": "So it meant three ,\n, then I would say two or three .\nokay .\nWait , what's the scale , one to seven , right ?\nYeah .\nYeah , one is high .\nOne's high-ish isn't it ? Ah , okay so yeah , two or three .\n'Kay\nOkay , it's upside-down .\nLet's go with two point five then .\nOkay , um  control\nhigh tech innovation .\nWell it has the wee jog-dial\nWe had to remove\nbut\nYeah , so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted ,\nMm .\nbut jog-dial\nSay it's more\nI'd go with three or four ,\n's good .\nEight\nmedium ,\nmaybe three .\nthree .\nbut going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing .\nOkay ,\nYeah about three , okay .\nthree ?\nYep .\nOkay , um\nStyle reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .\nLemon .\nI shouldn't have said colour , but just\nOkay , the blue the blue colours and  don't re don't actually represent the colour ,\nWell that's kind of\nSorta .\nYeah .\nexcept for the b the the red button ,\nYeah .\nthey  because for want of a\nOkay .\nBut the yellow , I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour ,\nRight . Yeah , could be . Yeah .\nYeah , the the yellow is more representative of the colour ,\ncouldn't it ?\nbut the button itself , the blue can be anything else .\nYeah .\nOkay . Okay so we'll go two .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah ? Okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features .\nWell yeah , I mean it's really basic looking isn't it ?\nF f yeah f fairly basic ,\nI mean I'd give that nearly a one .\nyou guys think ?\nYeah  one .\nYep , that's fine .\nYeah , one ? Okay .  Um ,  soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .\nYeah I think it's about five .\nFive ?\nFive ? That's really low .\nYeah well we have to use uh plastic\nYeah I suppose mm 'kay .\nThat's\nso it's probably gonna be\nUm\nYeah , company logo .\ncould we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? Was that an option ?\nI think it'll be cost prohibitive ,\nI think I'd probably increase the cost .\nIt would cost more than plastic .\nWe've only got  like what , ten cents left so\nyeah .\nOkay , logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?\nYep .\nYep . Gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there or something ?\nHuh . And um it's within budget , yep . It is , isn't it ?\nYeah .\nOkay , so we can say then that uh out of a possible  or what would be our goal here ?\nOut of forty nine , I guess .\nYeah , out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .\n'S pretty good .\nSo it's pretty good . Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . Right ?\nUh yeah .\nI think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about\nTwice that ,\nabout thirty one ,\nabout thirty one .\nand then invert that , it's\nSo yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah .\nOh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent .\nIt's pretty good .\nOkay , good . That was just a little formality for us to go through .\nOkay .\nYep , oh hundred pound pen .\nSorry   alright .\nNobody saw it , honestly .\nNo .\nThe cameras did .\nHmm .\nIs that you all have all finished , or\nYeah that's that's me . I did have one other um one other frame I thought , I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .\nUh-huh .\nIt's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um\nMm-hmm .\nCould our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant ,\nYep .\nI dunno the   Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon .\nOkay .\nIt's just discussion . I mean obviously we can just abandon this , it's fine . I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do .\nRight .\nUm , yep so there . That's all .\nOkay , great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I ? I don't know what your instructions have been .\nUm , I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet .\nOkay ,\nYeah .\nuh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes ,\nbecause if you're submitting it anyway then\nI will , yeah .\nOkay great .\nIt keeps getting too big .\nCool . Um right , uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .\n'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well .\nOh right , okay .\nJust in case you're wondering  , why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ?\nHuh .\nJust about right\nL_E_G_O_ Lego  .\nMy leg .\nRight , okay . Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and   or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that .  You got a different uh\nYep . I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that .\nOh yeah , they're good aren't they , yeah .\nIt's really quick .\nRight okay ,\nTo use .\num yeah here we are . Uh as a note we'll do this alphabetically .  Um do you wanna start Andrew ?\nSure , um so what is it you're asking of me now ?\nI don't know , just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them .\nOr sort of our work on setting this up .\nYeah .\nYeah . Well , is it  uh okay I'll just go through your system then . The the room uh is fairly institutional , but um the main thing is , I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know ,\nUh-huh .\nas in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a\nWell d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?\nd debating  Yeah , yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .\nBut I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room . I think it means like you know\nOh , oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ\nYeah .\nOh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room .\nRoom . Oh yeah .\nNo , of course , yeah .\nWell I dunno do you th I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so\nSorry . Huh . Yeah . Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours .\nMm .\nSo what do we do . We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds ,\nOkay .\nso actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual\nYou feel like you're caged within whatever y\nOkay .\nYeah within the constraints\nIt's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side .\nthe\nYeah .\nThe constraints do come in very fast .\nOkay uh do you know what ,\nYeah , yeah .\nactually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think .\nSo\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig .\nUm I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYep .\nI think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings ,\nYeah .\nso time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nBecause for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to  allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .\nMm .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .  Yeah , yeah .\nAnd I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing ,\nYeah .\nand I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts\nYeah , sure .\nI feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right\nYeah .\nit it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .\nYeah . New creativity .\nI feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know .\nYep .\nSo you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or\nRight .\nNot not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear\nYeah , but actual environment ?\nyeah you know that creates boundaries to that um\nMm .\nand and the time the time given also restricts\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nVery good . Um what about leadership ?\nI don't know if that means like , if I did a good job or something .\nI don't really know .\nYeah , well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement\nFrom like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ?\nYeah from  and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader .\nOkay .\nUm yeah I think I think it's\nExcuse me .\nI think it's good . I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and\nMm-hmm .\nyou know , innovative thought with . In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your  the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a  quite a con confining framework to work within . And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so\nUh-huh , okay .\nBut it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free\nSo you think maybe a little too controlling or\nYeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .\nI think controlling is not the right word , I think the interactions are very structured .\nYeah maybe not co confining .\nI think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling .\nYeah . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nOkay .\nI don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nbut that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way .\nUh-huh .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIt doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the\nOkay .\nMm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Yeah .\nOkay , uh what about teamwork ?\nUm did , you wanna comment Craig ?\nUh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nIf we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nI think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate ,\nFully agree .\nbut um it just comes back to us so slow in the email\nMm .\nYeah .\num it it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go  .\nDid uh did you guys get the email I sent you ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOh that's alright .\nNot just yet .\nI was wondering if that got there okay .\nYeah , got the email .\nOkay .\nOkay , um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier .\nYeah .\nI think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .\nYeah , in it  Mm-hmm ,\nThey don't support the team working together , you know ,\nmm-hmm , mm-hmm ,\nOh right , okay .\nexactly . Yeah , I mean if you\nthey're still very individual tools .\nYeah , I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation\nMm .\nI I don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different ,\nWe had Play-Doh fun  .\nbut um yeah , but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept , and we sit here together and do it ,\nYeah .\nwell that's what teamwork is . To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .\nYeah . Okay .\nUm not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done .\nOkay .\nI'm not dissatisfied with it .\nRight , uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ?\nNo , not really .\nOkay , um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? Um did anybody think anything was like really useful ,\nMm-hmm .\nanything was pretty un f  unsupportive ?\nI think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .\nMm .\nUm , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss\nMm-hmm . Yeah . And point at ? Yeah .\nand and and in a way everybody's  as we discuss things in the  in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just  we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . It wasn't until we had this here , you know ,\nYeah .\nlike at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book .\nAh .\nBut the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um\nSo do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ?\nThink could be , yeah .\nI think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,\nYeah .\nYeah , yeah .\nand I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .\nYeah . Yeah , yeah .\nIt will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nor maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place ,\nYeah . Yeah , yeah .\nyou know in the centre of the\nOkay .\nYeah , because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it ,\nAlright .\num 'ca you know , just 'cause that's sorta how we  what we were set up to to use while we had our time .\nOkay uh\nI think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings  . 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent  we spent a lot of time doing that .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually  it could have , we could have gone through it  verbally ,\nYeah .\nNo , not quite .\nespecially my slides ,\nYeah .\nI felt that they just you know\nYeah .\nOkay .\nas opposed to having to present them .\nYeah .\nWhat about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?\nYep clunky .\nSure , yeah .\nOh they're a bit clunky .\nAgreed .\nYeah .\nYeah .  Yep .\nClunky , okay .\nMm .\nUm\nHaving to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , 'cause you're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump .\nYeah .\nMm .\nI know , I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff , didn't click note on one ,\nYeah .\nthen went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something ,\nHmm . Hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nbut they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since .\nHmm .\nBut I think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't  have to worry .\nYeah ,\nMm-hmm ,\nSo I think the pen's good .\nyeah .\nmm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIt's about the best thing .\nAnd o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .\nYeah .\nIt just occurred to me that they all\nYeah we only needed one computer and\nWe only actually needed one computer .\nYeah , that's true .\nIf there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time .\nGood point .\nAnd the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know ,\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nit's useful but\nYeah .\nDo you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ?\nI think too many computers are just distracting .\nYeah .\nUm\nOkay . I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that ,\nMm-hmm . Yep . Mm-hmm .\nYep .\nMm-hmm .\num I don't know about anybody else .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  what else uh any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . Um I don't know is\nIs this for the project or\ncould you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ?\nWell , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .\nMm . Yeah if we just had uh\nSo , that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .\nMm-hmm .  Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about\nOh yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nThe only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there  maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um  yeah .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nI really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\njust to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but\nMm-hmm .\nThere you go . Um so in closing ,\nHmm .\nI haven't got my five minutes to go . Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go .\nWonderful . Okay um are the costs within the budget , yes they are . And is the project evaluated , yes it is . So now celebrate  .\nGreat .\nAnd we have Ninja Homer .\nSo it  So now we\nOh yeah .\nWell apparently now I write the final report . What are you guys doing now ?\nDo we know what the other ones are ?\nI I don't know .\nYou dunno ?\nOh wow .\nHmm .\nThat is lovely .\nHey yeah , I said Ninja Homer .\nWhat did you call it ?\nNinja Homer . See it looks like Homer Simpson\nHuh , huh .\nbut it's electronic so it's made in Japan .\nSo is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ?\nLogo .\nYeah it's just a logo .\nJust a logo and then like Ninja Homer ,\nHuh .\nNinja Homer .\nright okay .\nMm .\nThe the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it .\nMm-hmm .\nI think it's quite nice .\nFashion technology or something .\nYou can wear Homer ,\nyou can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh .\nHmm , hmm , hmm .\nOh no , that's cool , it's got  I'm kind of\nIt's clunky .\nHmm .\nI'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , I think that would have been nice .\nYeah , yeah .\nAh well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money .\nMm-hmm .\nOh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful .\nHmm .\nNo it is it is .\nPlay-Doh s\nIt is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative .\nHuh . Huh .\n'Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for .\nReally ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nLike we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else .\nDid they ?\nYou might wanna write that down . It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool .\nYeah .\nOkay . Play-Doh .\nNo , it's true , yeah .\nGuess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells .\nYeah , it smells funny doesn't it . Um\nHmm . And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they ?\nNo , all Play-Doh is edible .\nYeah like the stuff for\nI think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds .\nI think it has to be , yeah .\nIt's just wheat , it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh\nYeah um so to\nWow , hmm .\nwha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh ?\nIt's helpful to the creative process .\nHuh .\nUm it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch .\nOkay .\nYep .\nAnd it helps you to understand\nTaste .\ndimension as well . I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nwhereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of\nYeah .\nMm-hmm , yep . Yeah .\nYeah\nYeah .\nit's not very tangible .\nyeah  tangible , that's a nice word .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm ,\nIt becomes tangible .\nmm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nTangible . Okay uh\nMm . I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss .\nNope .\nThat that's about it really . Just sit still I guess for a little while .\nDo we retreat to our , to continue our\nI think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate .\nUm\nr reporting or what i\nWell I dunno . Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now .\nCan we turn off the microphones ?\nYeah , yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "scale, lemon, colours, colour, tones", "dialogue_id": 87}, {"text": "So we come to the third meetings . I have  good .\nUm so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . So we will talk about some specific details .\nOkay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh  I'm participant two .\nThis\nComponents design .\nOkay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique  to to store the energy .\nWe also um  we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Now\nUh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . But if we use battery\nYeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex .  But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the   from the technical uh point of view . Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .\nMm .\nAnd uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work  in a cluttered uh  uh environment .\nMm .\nSo um so I think we can start with these two main things . For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are  mm will be uh very happy to have a  a a nice remote . For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip  that are uh well cheaper .\nMm .\nAnd s so uh we can move to the next slide .\nSorry .\nYeah .\nWhat is this single curved  what does it mean ?\nWell uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote .\nSo it's it's not\nYou you will have the  well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the\nYo l yeah . When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold .\nYeah . It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat .\nOkay . Yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ?\nYeah the um that's the point . The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um\nThat that's what it means by kinetic .\nYeah and by  well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy .\nOkay . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nBut I d I don't know it's  if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy .\nMm .  Mm . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product  ready for market .\nYeah .  And  yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said .\nMm mm .   Wha\nSo uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh  if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .\nAh the department . Mm .\nThat's it .\nUh  So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department .\nOh yeah\nI take care , it's all right .\nSo the titanium case is the normal case that  I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not .\nAll right . Yeah .\n'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . There's another point I want to make , is that the uh  well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some  why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can  use  Yeah . Yeah , maybe n\nWe will , okay .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "energy, battery, solar, meeting, dynamo", "dialogue_id": 88}, {"text": "Three .\nYeah .  So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user\nand the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh  we are more  we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing .\nWhat's the function of this button .\nYeah . Yeah . So .\nI think it makes the the interface really\nEa easy to use . So next one .\nGraphical user interface  .\nfunction five . So I can use the button , the mouse maybe .\nA graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .\nYeah . So next line . So the  here are some examples . So they cluster the buttons together . They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . Mm but this interface are kind of confusing . Uh basically there are too many buttons . Right . Next one .\nYeah .\nSo some people are propose voice recognition and so  ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine  for this by a company\nwhen you tell the  you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . So I just got an email saying that .\nMm-hmm mm mm .\nAnd it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly .\nYeah fine .\nThe next one . Mm so somebody  some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real  so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean .\nYeah .\nNext one . And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . Like the one we have here . Uh , next one . So mm\nMm-hmm .\nso there are a few aspects that I collected here . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh mm  yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . So  But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the  currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f  customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point . The next one . And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nS a good idea .\nThe next one .\nSo this guy  this is another company that provides big buttons . At  I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use .\nYeah .\nAnd you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is .\nT_V_ remote controller where are you ?\nAnd then , he will beeps and to say that I am here ,  for example .\nWe should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?\nIs it possible ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUh ?\nYeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh  the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top  on the top up arrow   if you\nMm-hmm .\nup arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design .\nYeah yeah .\nAnd here are  is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . Yeah . So  we have many concepts there\nHmm .\nbut we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used .\nYeah .\nAnd basically uh\nWell I  I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities\nYeah .\nbut uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote\nMm-hmm .\nsince we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that ,\nYeah . Mm .\nbecause uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .\nMm . Okay .\nOr maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control  and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ .\nYeah . That's a good idea .\nTo have a help button .\nA help button .\nYeah .\nSo you are display on the screen .\nYeah .\nOn T_V_ T_V_ screen .\nSo  on the T_V_ screen .\nOn the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote .\nSo just you push the button\nOkay . Okay . Okay .\nand we will\nOh .\nSo that eliminates all the complicated documentation  ,\nYeah .\nokay . So wi\nBut people are often enough looking at the help ,\nIf the if\nonce they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff .\nNo  In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .\nUh yeah .\nIt's a psychology .\nIn a marketing point of view .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nAnd let us see what the market demands .\nYeah .\nWe could just go to my presentation .\nBut  uh wel well I think\nIt's just for user customizable , for kids or old people .\nYeah that's right .\nMm .\nSo\nI mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the\nSo it's the same\nSame remote with some\nCan be used by both kids and old people .\nBoth yeah .\nMm .  Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i  it could be a cube ,\nis uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the  um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls .\nMaybe for kids , kids they like uh t no l they like to\nSmall\nUh well .\nYeah .\nSo le le let's see what uh what  people want .\nLet's see the market demand .\nAnd then we can decide what what we can  yeah .\nWhat what  market  yes yes .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "interface, buttons, graphical, programmable, button", "dialogue_id": 88}, {"text": "So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . And we found the following solutions which we could  which would be helpful for our design . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot .\nYeah .\nAnd fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nso the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times .\nYeah . Yes .\nSo this were the findings which we found . And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . Most of  fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them  rather than watching the T_V_ .\nYeah .\nAnd by the time they found the remote control the program is finished .\nYeah .\nSo  they're frustrated a lot\nAnd um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .\nMm .\nMm , the functionalities yeah .\nSo you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex .\nYeah .\nSo keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control .\nOh .\nWell mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen .\nBig screen .\nIt's\nMm-hmm ?\nyeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce  and it's not really\nI mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy .\nYeah .\nSo if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control .\nMm yeah .\nYeah yeah .\nMm . The thing\nWe just  play around\nYeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have  a big screen in front of you , s\nYou can use this screen instead of the big se screen ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\ninstead of use the  yeah .\nIf you re-use the existing screen , we element  eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display\nHmm .\nand if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ ,\nYeah .\nmaybe even better .\nYeah .\nSo\nI mean this were the points which we got from the market demands .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah yeah .\nYeah .\nSo\nSo I th I I  well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh\nYeah . More on a fancy design .\nYeah that's fine .\non the speech recognition if the technology is available\nYeah . I mean that's\nYeah .\nbut well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results .\nMm . Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller .\nMm-hmm .\nBut  Yeah .\nYeah . So i is\nUh yeah we have uh\nso the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again .\nI mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers .\nUh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time  . Is i if i\nSo price of uh L_C_D_ display .\nYeah .\nAnd\nAnd it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .\nYeah . And also the cost for the speech recognition .\nMm . It's for\nAsk our R_ and D_ department .\nYeah .\nit's just for small vocabulary . We  it's not\nYeah .\nYeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary ,\nyeah .\nYeah . And ho\nsay eighty commands or so .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah okay .\nAnd also the scroller button , how much will it cost .\nAnd  Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button .\nYeah . Push push  .\nMm , the scroll button ,  from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button .\nYeah . Yeah I think that\nBecause they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or  help button .\nYeah .\nYeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button\nDon't use the buttons .\nso uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nIt doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .\nYeah .\nImportant .\nYeah . But\nBut they are just less used compar\nThey're not used much .\nyeah .\nBut the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen\nYeah .\nlike uh a a list of function\nYeah . Mm .\nand then you choose with the with the button to  well you navigate\nYeah , yeah . So so the at most  more power uh .\nand you\nOr maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .\nYeah .\nSo .\nBut if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen  I think that just five buttons are sufficient ,\nYep .\none to go up left right down and uh enter\nYeah .\nand you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that .\nMm . Mm . Yeah .\nYou don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh\nMm .\nYeah .\nOr it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands .\nYeah but\nSo if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff .\nMm .\nYeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen\nAnd accordingly you can just increase or decrease .\nIt's\nMm . Mm .\nso  i i it's not really worth to get  to have the image if you don't look at , so .\nI if  Mm . Mm .\nAnd I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah that has to be checked out .\nI think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness\nYeah .\nand then you t turn  you just press lef increase or decrease button\nand the same for the volume and the channel ,\nYeah .\nif you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ ,\nOkay .\nwith the help of speech recogniser you can\nI mean ,  better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_\nYeah .\nand also with the speech recognition .\nMm .\nYeah .\nAnd then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case .\nMm . Mm .  Yeah . A and\nAnd the third problem was to find the remote control . Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes .\nWell so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find\nMm .\nand  when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t\nYou will listen to a peep ,  special peep .\nWhere  , yeah .\nYeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander .\nYeah .\nOr it could be also something like this ,\nYeah .\nuh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control ,\nMm .\nYeah .\nso we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger .\nPut it back at the charge .\nPut\nYeah .\nAnd when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah . And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones .\nYeah .\nMm .\nI mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command ,\nBut you don't you don't have to move the the charger .\nYeah .\nbecause there are problems with a voice command .\nHmm . Mm .  Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm .\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nYou have to keep it  .\nI mean charger would be fixed\nYeah .\nbecause it's always with electricity plugged .\nYeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . Also and uh uh the remote is lost .\nOkay .\nMm . There's  mm . Mm .\nYeah .\nYeah that's right .\nThat  we can  what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . You never get it lost\nYeah .\nbecause uh every time you're off the computer   the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where  to the charger .\nIt's an good reminder ,\nYeah . So you will never get lost   yeah .\nyeah that's right .\nOkay .\nMaybe for some people   lazy people .\nYeah . Yeah because everything is programmed inside .\nYeah yeah .\nSo it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y\nAnd of course the final point is a fancy look .\nMm .\nAs we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy ,\nMm .\nThey were ugly .\nYeah , yeah .\nI mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons .\nThey\nMm .\nI think we should have something  it\nWell the last one with the um  yeah with the two parts was uh  original , so\nWith uh two two two parts controller .\nI mean  uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and  use it , you can't avoid him .\nYeah .\nBut you can have an button for child lock .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm .\nSo just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even\nMm . Mm . Mm . Mm .\nWell we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that .\nMm uh\nMm .\nOr\nMm . Yeah . Mm .\nThat's right .\nOr maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just  yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically\nMm .  these are probl yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm .\n. So if he  .\nI think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think\nSo for mm\nYeah .\nMm .\nyeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .\nYeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these  could be included .\nYeah .\nMm .  I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser\nYeah .\nbecause uh if you want  uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut if  name the channel by by name\nWell I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now\nMm .\nand and uh\nNo , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh  basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five\nYeah it's  yeah .\nand suddenly  the screen the channel goes to twenty five .\nMm .\nThat's right , yeah , yeah .\nSo I think there should be a prefix to some numbers\nWell but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so .\nYeah .\nI mean the the  you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five .\nMm .\nYeah yeah .\nOrdinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent\nMm .\nYeah but well  okay .\nand T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nSo it's better to have some prefix  before the number .\nBut I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .\nYeah something , some code .\nYou say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel .\nYeah yeah .\nSo some people may want to say , I want to see this channel .\nMm mm . Well I\nThat will be too big .\nOr just\nAnd it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .\nYeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser .\nIt's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .\nUh ?\nBecause you have to s t uh a ch\nWell , it's convenient for the user .\nyeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .\nAls might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .\nOr maybe\nYeah .\nThen\nOr maybe the user can create his own vocabulary ,\nThe  uh uh mm .  Mm .\njust pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .\nI I think that I have  mm mm  I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh  if  when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the  you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want\nYeah , the  .\nand then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So\nOr lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .\nMm . So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way .\nNo . Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train  you have to create the vocabulary by yourself .\nOh , okay . Yeah .\nWell I uh I also\nBy associating each channel with the name or\nI I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_\nAnd for each one has his own .\nthe s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .\nYeah yeah ,  .\nBecause uh I remember when I was a  young child with my sister we  yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time\nMm .\nOr you have to s\nYeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that .\nYeah .\nso it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty  and just run , s\nMm .\nA and in the same lines we would have a  one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name  bad uh reputation for our company .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nMm .\nMm .\nSo I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something .\nYeah .\nOr we can switch on or switch off the the special  , yeah .\nYeah that's right that should be an option .\nMm .\nYeah that's  well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so .\nHmm .\nI think these are the practical problems . So we need to take care of them in the design .\nMaybe we'll discuss them in next meeting .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remotes, controls, remote, buttons, control", "dialogue_id": 88}, {"text": "It's time to close this meeting .\nWell , you you stay a five minutes .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nYeah  .

Welcome . Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh  f the remote control has to support .\nThi\nSo who wants go .\nMm-hmm .\nYes .\nYes ?\nWho wants to start ?\nMe first again or\nYeah sure . Doesn't matter .\nOh . No . Yeah . No problem\nyeah . Alright . Did you open it already or\nNo .\nno . Ah . Ah . Yes . So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . Um this time about trendwatching .  Uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . Uh it shows a number of developments . Uh I will address them uh in a moment . Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . So um the developments I will address them\noh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . So to give you an idea . Um well the developments ? Uh development one .  Uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition ,\nSound . Yeah yeah uh uh .\nso I don't expect that to be a problem . And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . Um  Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect .\nMm-hmm .\nSo um that kind of gets you this ratios . So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention .\n.\nUh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . Um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . Um and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . So my point of attention is especially this part .\nYeah .\nThat this will be a crux . So that was the marketing uh presentation . I had only one document left .\nAnd shall I go first ?\nYeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind .\nSo I\nThat's\nYeah yeah sure . No .\nSo kind of this\nDo you want to go first ? Okay .\nYeah ?\nSo a k a small example .\nYeah .\nKind of this this look .\nUh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours\nYeah .\nI dunno .  Just made a quick design .\nCool .  Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ?\nIt's better than than my uh drawing .\nAlright .\nAlright .\nYeah okay but I have to design the\nUh components .\nYeah layout .\nYeah .\nYeah okay .\nOh no .\nYeah . It's okay .\nYou probably opened it .\nYeah true . Um\nF_ five .\nF_ five .\nAlright . So\nI'm dealing with the components design . Um let's see . I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . That's why I had to , wanted to go first . Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can  and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . There is a lot of um  factors involved in choosing the components .\nThere's a lot of options that we have to discuss . Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . The basic battery . Uh we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt .\nYeah .\nUh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it .\nWhich will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the\nYeah .\nAnd uh of course solar cells . But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product .\nWi an indoors .\nSo uh my\nYeah okay .\nOh .\nCalculator's can do it .\nyeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo that's not cool either . So um  for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . Or the double curved . Um  I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . Uh the case materials .\nYeah .\nWell we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays .\nYeah .\nUm poo , this is a lot of text . I wasn't able to organise this yet . We have yeah several uh interface designs . Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons .\nYeah . Pushbuttons . Yeah .\nSo that's not really interesting .\nYeah .\nElectronics ? Yeah ,  maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use  the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . Um  Yeah . I think this is about it . Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy ,\nYeah .\nwhere you have to move the thing to be able to use it .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAs an optional uh feature .\nYeah .\nOr combine uh both with a with one uh\nUh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the\nYeah maybe we\nI guess we can only choose one .\nOkay .\nI can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again .\nYeah\nYeah . And it's more fun .\nI didn't receive any info uh .\nAnd it's also more fun yeah . I always chuck my uh remote control around , so\nYeah , just playing with it\nYeah .\nand  especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it ,\nS yeah it's safe .\nAnd throw it  .\nYeah y exactly .\nso it's a perfect combination I guess .\nYou don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSo that's the end of it .\nYeah .\nSo\n'Kay next .\nUh go ahead .\nSo double curved is like this , this , this , or\nNo it means curved in two dimensions . So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension .\nMm .\nAnd double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . Like three D_ . Yeah .\nYeah . Also in in height ?\nUh\nYeah okay .\nOkay . Can we uh\nYeah . One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . We were going to use that .\nYeah .\nYeah . So um   Yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control .\nWell the visual representation is not there with speech\nDesign ?\nNo okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and\nbut you can  Yeah . Just  yeah .\nSo okay .\nI think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present .\nYeah .\nSo I don't think you have to design anything else for that .\nOkay .\nYeah with the programme .\nBut do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ?\nBoth .\nFor for everything ,\nYeah .\nalso for the advanced options ? Okay . Uh we have this  very uh basic uh trendy design . Everybody says it so that's what's uh  yeah um  Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . That's yeah obvious . Um yeah . Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options .\nAnd and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah . Um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your  yeah .\nyou have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout .\nYeah .\nUh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button .\nThat would be the back .\nI'm  The back .\nBack and okay .\nYeah .\nBack and okay yeah .\nBack and okay .\nYou did read the minutes I wrote ?\nUh\nYou did read the minutes I wrote ?\nWhat ? A little bit I think but not not everything w\nI\nOh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So\nOkay . Oh  I uh didn't read that .\nI hate doing work for nothing .\nBut   But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons .\nUm  I wanted to to categorise everything . Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light .\nMm-hmm .\nSo you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous  so that's an a also an option . Um that was it .\nThat was it ?\nYeah .\nOkay . Uh   again . Ugh .  Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy .\nNo .\nUh the case would be doubly curved . So\nAnd rubber . Rubber material .\nRubber material .\nRubber material . And that's the only thing we have left .\nYeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function .\nOh okay . No it's easy .\nSo that's uh  is that is that the advanced chip ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nAdvanced chip . Okay .\nOtherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more .\nWow . Yeah . Alright .\nI'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost ,\nKinetic . Double curved .\nToo  .\nto be able to m\nUh I didn't get any info on this . So\n.\nSo 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThat's gonna be difficult huh ?\nThe cost of making it should be twelve and a half ?\nI have total here .\nYeah .\nYeah I don't know .\nYeah yeah yeah .\nI didn't get any information about that so\n. We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem .\nYeah .\nChild labour man , we love it .\nYeah , so it's cheap .\nWho doesn't . Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ?\nUm well the interface type supplements .\nYeah the interface , maybe can\nUh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh  yeah .\nOoh . No . Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder .\nUm let me see . Wait a sec .\nIf you go to your homepage or something , you should\nYeah I'm going there now .\nget your own information .\nInspiration .\nI got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so\nAh you didn't draw it yourself .\nWell\nNo .\nAh .\nToo less time .\nUm  yeah maybe it's\nYeah , also the menu .\nYeah .\nYeah that that w\nThis is the the menu I was uh looking uh at .\nYeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow .\nMaybe it's easier\nYeah .\nArrow .\nArrow yeah .\nYeah .\nSo that indicates that there's an menu under that menu .\nYeah . Yeah perfect .\nYeah .\nSo\n. 'S the target group .\nMaybe it's easier if you guys come over here .\nS yeah .\nYeah sure .\nS see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know .\nOh yeah .\nIt's like really basic . But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThis is what we're looking for . And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions .\nOh okay . I see .\nNot only like this but it has to be\nYeah also like this . So you can hold it .\nexactly . It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know ,\nYeah .\nwhere your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And\nBut it has also to  it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people .\n.\nTh this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So\nIt ha\nThe children's story . Yeah I've got it .\nYeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually ,\nDistinction . Yeah .\n'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . And\nYeah .\nYeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always ,\nThe colour  Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with  LEDs uh beneath the the buttons .\nyou know , with the\nMm-hmm .\nIf you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it .\nMm .\nThere is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights .\nYeah .\nMaybe we should consider this function .\nMm-hmm .\nTo customise it and so  I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours\nYeah .\nand people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour\nDifferent . Mm-hmm .\nlike uh for example this uh photo th camera .\nCamera .\nYeah .  Cool . S underwater uh\nYeah submarine .\nyeah .\nPersonally I think it's really ugly .\nWell\nYeah .\nJust give me the thing that it's inside there\nYeah but this this the  is for the  .\nVery cheap uh cheap look .\nmaybe I'm too old for this stuff .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay . Uh\nSo those I think are all my\n.\noh .\nAh yeah bright colours .\nYeah . Also a kind of rubber uh\nAnd this is , this is with the curved that I mean .\nYeah .\nThat's singly curved .\nYeah . Yeah ?\nOkay .\nThat should be nice .\nWell we could make a compromise between that . But I don't know if it's worth the effort .\nA compromise between what ?\nUh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public .\nSo s\nThis , this would be uh single curved uh ?\nMm-hmm .\nYeah there's only in in this dimension .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nLike this . So curvy or not  .\nAlso .\nYeah .  Exactly . Exactly .\nYeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ?\nYeah that would be an option . I don't know what you think .\nI think the\nYeah .\nI mean our aim is to make something different right ? To make something new .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nI would go for the double curved .\nOkay . Yeah I'd agree .\nAnd I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb .\nMm-hmm .\nSo it kind of holds nicely , something like that .\nYeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons .\nWell this is really your decision but\nYeah .\nIf you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons .\nYeah . As well . You can make a trigger button or something like that .\nYeah . Something to shoot at your television\nYeah or that that is the confirmation button or something ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nthat you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm .\nThat's  yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nThat would be a nice way to use it but  I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that  that you can able to use in one hand I think .\nDifferent . Stands out . Or  Oh yeah a one hand uh solution .\nYeah .\nSo from top view it looks kinda like this . But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape .\ncan turn it maybe .\nMaybe because the the screen is on top you can have\nTo switch from buttons to interface hmm . If you turn it a little .  .\n.\nMaybe you can c have this kind of shape . A little upwards . So that the screen is more\nOh yeah . Least you can easily see it .\ntowards yourself , so you can easily see your screen .\nHow about\nWell well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . So then you have double double curved in some way . So this this is so the screen is positioned over here .\nMm-hmm .\nOh . Something like that . And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but\nYeah I understand what you mean .\nThat's uh that's\nHow about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop .\nIf you can uh flip .\nSo that the only the simple functions will be visible at first .\nYeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or\nAnd then if you want\nUh so you have a the the side view .\nYeah . Something like that .\nBut then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . But I dunno if that's too expensive .\nSo and you want to be able to\nYeah .\nI mean maybe it's too much\nmake this\nNo uh like\n.\nI would draw it like this . Let's say this is the side view . That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . If you know what I mean .\nOkay . Yeah .\nSo that it would come up like that .\nOkay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way .\nYeah or  preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons .\nYeah . Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Right . Yeah that's good idea .\nOh the advanced buttons . Right .\nThat's  the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nBut you you want\nF for the L_C_D_ menu right ?\nokay . You just want to hide them all ?\nYeah .\nSo w w\nNo not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons .\nThe  oh .\nYeah .\nBut you can hide the okay and the back uh button .\nYeah yeah yeah .\nAnd the menu button also because when you flip it open\nYeah .\nand you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically .\nOh\nActivate and th the  yeah .\nSo  okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open .\nWhy ? You could just make it mechanical .\nTrue . True . But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . You know a simple uh  with a\nYeah .  Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your\nThat's  but it's it's not\nYeah . Exactly .\nit's not very uh very strong uh  yeah if you drop it one time  .\nTrue . It uh c it can go open .\nWell yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever .\nIf you cover it with rubber . Mm .\nOkay .\nAn adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that .\nAnd\nYeah . So it can bounce .\nExactly . Exactly . We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break .\nYeah , uh  It's very no it's very strong .\nTh it's very solid yeah .\nYeah okay so that that may work .\nYeah .\nThat actually will offer some extra protection for the\nOkay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . Yeah .\nYeah .\nWhat kind of\nYeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th\nHarder .\nYeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there .\n.\nOkay . If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . With your uh wrist .\nThat you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f\nBut when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem .\nYeah .\nUh yeah . Yeah of course .\nMaybe can design two versions .\nYeah then w then you would have to to make it like this .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentations, presentation, powerpoint, slides, layout", "dialogue_id": 89}, {"text": "Yeah .\nBut that's that's very expensive uh\nLike like you drew here .\nYeah .\nAnd maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre .\nMm-hmm .\nGive it\nAnd ergonomical shape . Yeah .\nI would give it a female shape\nYeah .\nbut uh yeah . Anyway .\nYeah .\nThe female shape yeah . With two uh\nObviously .  Make it more appealing to guys .\nYeah .\nWe we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh\nI mean\nOh yeah . Some uh k esk uh  yeah .\nand so if you  Yeah .\nYeah but but that's optional for later I guess .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nI mean , we have to make\nYeah but we have hardware inside , which is  so it has to have some sort of basic shape .\nSome  yeah .\nYeah yeah .\nYeah we we better so choose one\nAnd also the screen , you cannot mould it .\nNo no no no .\nYou know kind of thing .\nYeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nBut that's the kind of the idea ,\nAnd then you can\nso it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb ,\nYou can place the screen here , which can come  .\nyou you can you can use ,\nYeah .\nyeah , you can use the button option\nSo the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ?\nAnd  but then I w I would\nSpongey .\nI would do the arrows here , kind of thing .\nSpongey can be reached by means of\nThose buttons ? And the simple buttons here ,\n.\nYeah .\nso that\nYeah .\nYeah . And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ?\nI Uh y eah that's what I mean .\nNo the arrow's over here .\nYeah .\nThe arrows over here ,\nYeah .\nand here the s simple uh\nYeah and then numbers .\nButtons . Okay .\nYeah . Alright .\nI think that uh it's a nice design .\nUh pretty nice design . Yeah .\nIt's cool .\nYeah it looks uh pretty fancy .\nYeah .\nor do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ?\nI dunno .\n.\nYeah that's\nUh bananas  wierd shape and other fruits also ,\nYeah .\nso it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours .\nYeah we could make\nI don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? Like some soft  green or something ?\nOrange or something .\nOr  and then\nOr blue ? Dark blue or\nOh yeah yeah , dark blue\nWe should use\nand then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana ,  an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that ,\nYeah .\nwith very uh bright tones I guess .\nMm .\nYeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow .\nSo you have something like\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control .\nYeah . Yeah okay yeah .\nIf you we uh  yeah . If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour ,\nalso for the for the more uh yeah for the  people .\nHuh cool .\nMm .  That doesn't really work . To draw , I guess .\nNo it's   .\nOh . What's this ?\nYeah it's text .\nRight .\nN no you have to exit .\nHm .\nYou could also make line with uh\nSo that's\nYeah . Two hours further .\nYeah .\nthickness . Oh .\nSo that's blue .\nOh . Wh why not go for the twenty ?\nMm . Yeah .\nYeah . That's what I call painting .\nMm .\nY\nSo that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah and then on top of that .\nIt's pretty nice . And then uh  Oh\nSome yellow .\nYeah with some some yellow banana\nBanana colour .\nAnd how about some uh some flashing standby lights ?\nLike   .\nLike you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones ,\nthe you know that   'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often .\nYeah ?\nSo it  not not only in in the colours  of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or\nHow do you mean ?\nYeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically .\nUm\nYeah .\nSome some\nYeah . Exactly .\nWell I think it's a bit too much but\nMaybe a\nYeah .\nYeah an orange . Well alright well this is more like purple I guess ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nbut  it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo uh yeah . That would be a nice uh nice device I guess .\nAnd which which colour should uh should I give the the display ? Uh\nWho ?\nOr\nI mean , the the colour of the background of the display ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nAh well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six  five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive .\nAnd then you can use yellow or semething . Why not ?  Aye .\nYeah .\nSo just just a  a blue blue backlight or something like that .\nMm . Yeah .\nGreen is too old-fashioned . But blue , blue's okay . J\nAs long as you loo  use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour .\nYeah\nLike this .\nmaybe a maybe a white a white backlight ?\nSo that people with uh with\nWhite backlight , and dark .\nDark uh letters , yeah .\nYeah . Whatever which is visible .\nYeah .\nI know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno .\nYeah .\nAnd also for people who are a bit colourblind .\nColourblind yeah .\nYeah . True .\nNo so that's mostly red and green I believe .\nWhich which uh colour should the buttons be ?\nThat's adjustable .\nWoah . All all buttons ?\nWhy adjustable ?\nYeah ? Or not .\nOkay .\nNo uh\nThat's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . Or is it uh too expensive ?\nBut  maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right ?\nIt's difficult .\nAnd if the background is very dark blue\nBlue . Maybe green .\nBut don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ?\nYeah you can\nLike the pictures I showed you guys . Those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy .\nYeah ?\nMm-hmm flashy .\nSo more like\nMm bzz .\nDoesn't work very well . Uh . More like this colour .\nYeah something like that , something that stands out more .\nAnd then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something .\nMm .\nYeah .\nBut then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or\nRed maybe .\nAnd it it looks quite cheap , that colour I think .\nUh\nBlack .\nIt's it's not\nThe green ?\nWhy ?\nYeah . I dunno .\nYeah but it's pretty fresh , on the other side .\nYeah . So\nIt's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment .\nIt's it's trendy okay . But\nYeah .\nMm .\nMy couch is in that colour .\nOoh .  .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWell it works pretty well .\nAnd then time was up .\nUh not yet .\nUh\nDo you get a pop-up if we\n.\nYeah within five minutes yeah .\nThat you have five minutes left or\nAlright .\nY left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out .\nSo something like this .\nYeah .\nThat should be pretty nice colour . But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people .\nYeah yeah .\nNo that's actu\nBecause the  of the green .\nBut the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ?\nThey have LEDs but they have a colour .\nYeah .\nRed and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind .\nYeah ?\nThey will see one of each as grey . But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nI think .\nSo red buttons are okay ?\nI think so .\nYou can make them red .\nOkay . That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons .\nYeah . But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light .\nHow do you mean ?\nUh they they don't determine the colour that much , I think .\nYeah .\nOkay . Yeah I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and\n'Cause you have to print on them  you have a background\nNo that's that's too busy I guess .\nYeah .\nEach number is transparent .\nYeah .\nUh partly but you have to print on the number . Or the the sign .\nOkay .\nSo you can't  change the colour so\nYou better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSo just an extra\nBit of light .\nYou can\nbit of light and attention .\nBit of feedback .\nwhat we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo that the whole button will shine\nMm-hmm .\nas the colour the    And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands ,\nbut also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nOkay with  Uh  Don't mean to discourage you but  uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . Next thirty minutes to design something so\nAh , right .\nAlright .\nAnd the  You will do the evaluation .\nOf the product ?\nYeah .\nWhich we don't have yet .\nYeah uh about\nSo wh how should I do that ?\nYeah I don't know .  You probably get a mail .\nOh okay . Or you you or you send it to me . Or just\nYeah . Once they are finished . Yeah .\nbecause you are going to design it on this board right ?\nYeah but maybe you can do the evaluation  you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . I don't know .\nYeah . I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that ,\nYeah .\nso I make another presentation I guess .\nYeah .\nI kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so\nAbout . Yeah . You have the basic idea .\nI've a basic idea .\nAnd you two uh are going to do this . Look-and-feel and\nYeah .\nSo we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nGood luck .\nAlright . Thanks .\nYeah . Alright so that's uh\nSo I  uh make new page and uh be creative .\nYeah .\nBut we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ?\nAlright .\nYeah you have uh\nThirty minutes .\nthirty minutes .\nOkay .\nThen we have to uh see something which we can uh\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAlright .\nshow to the management .\nAh so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ?\nYeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "shape, design, mouse, sketchboard, objects", "dialogue_id": 89}, {"text": "I would yeah .\nShall we uh make a new uh\nYeah .\nYeah l let's just uh delete all these uh  or\nYeah .\nNext .\n.\nYeah , I just  make a new one .\nOh , next  .\nYeah .\nOh and save this uh board .\nAlright .\nJust save it .\nHuh ? Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there .\nYeah okay but just press save and uh\nYeah .\nIt'll be fine .\nOn the left . S so , yeah .\nUh sorry .\nYou can also include clip-art .\nOkay .\nSo if you'll rather draw in paint or something\nCurrent colour ?\nYeah .\nSo um\nOkay . Uh\nShall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ?\nYeah . And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface .\nBecause  I I\nthen look .\nYeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design .\nThis ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo how it's gonna look . And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things .\nUh pretty accurate .\nSo if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct .\nOh we skip this I guess . Sound  button press .\nYep .\nYeah .\nUh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches .\nYou can also include it . It's not much work .\nOh no it's it's okay .\nLight only button user ca user interaction .\nso we kind of want the girlish\nThat's included .\nYeah .\nYeah okay .\nYeah .\nfigure .\nSo the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . So\nI'm not so good at drawing . Excuse me ?\nWell it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on  when when they are usable .\nYeah . Yeah .\nNo uh uh .\nMaybe you should draw it very large  like this .\nYeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly .\nYeah . Sensitive .\nOh right .\nHow do we uh uh\nErase ?\nor insert text ?\nI dunno . Maybe just start typing .\nIt's a bit uh large .\nOh that's a bit big . Yeah .\nYou also do the other sides . Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view .\n.\nYeah . Ex exactly .\nL let's make first the the the all the views . The the front view , side view and the back view .\nUh\nUh .\nUh I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your\nJesus . What do I write down ?\nYeah .\nWhy can't I work here ? This is much easier .\nYeah .\nMuch easier , yeah .\nYeah .\n'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and\nThe middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand .\nMm .\nI don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but\nExactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think .\nNo so I just work here a few minutes .\nYeah .\nYeah the display ,\nUh don't you think ?\nwe yeah we can put a display .\nSo the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it's most reachable .\nYeah .\nThe\nThe the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah .\nThe th Exactly . Oh . This is hard .\nWhat do   don't have to draw it exactly do we ?\nNo it's it's uh it's okay .\nWait . Let me try it one more time . Maybe I've uh  it's easier if I draw it in once . Okay , of course it will become way more ugly .\nYou can make it m larger . Maybe it's easier to to draw uh\nYeah . This'll take forever . It's fun to work with this pen .\nUm so , larger .\nOh .\nYeah that's that's the basic idea . Yeah .\nAnd\nWrong one .\nyeah . So side .\nFive minutes left before the meeting ends .\n'Kay . Um other views ?\nAlright .\nYeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit .\nUh\nThat's the question .\nYeah .  Let's fill i fill in the buttons later .\nBut we we\nYeah .\nSo this is gonna be from the\nI is it  if if this is from the side\nuh from\nFrom the\nwoah . Steady .\nyeah yeah . Sorry .\nBecause there the screen goes up like that right ?\nYeah .\nSo then it's like this ,\nYeah ?\nor  that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the  it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ?\nYeah I'm I'm\nThe the idea is that it has to flip up to here .\nMay maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . Because it do doesn't have to flip then .\nOkay .\nBecause we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D .\nYeah . Yeah yeah yeah .\nBecause here\nIt's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this .\nTrue .\nBut why why do we need uh the flipping uh\nyou can adjust the angle to which it flips . So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there .\nOkay . Yeah .\nYou can flip it up to there if you want .\nYeah . So w yeah . But we still keep the flipping mechanism .\nYeah we keep the flip ?\nYeah .\nThink so .\nKeep the flip live .\nYeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that\nYeah .\nI dunno .\nUh the the shape is okay but  yeah ? I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism .\nI thought it would be cool .\nYeah .\nBecause we  Okay yeah . It's it's for for for more trendy uh\nYeah but maybe  Yeah but maybe we we should then\nBecause we have enough space . H here we got uh the basic functions , the the arrow uh yeah button .\nYeah there the middle  Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ?\nYeah and then h we sh mm .\nAnd then like i oh th\ndoh . Come on . So this is the shape . Oh . It hasn't\n. It doesn't aim so well .\nOkay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen .\nYeah , then it's\nSo there's a layer of rubber on the side .\nYeah yeah yeah . Definitely .\nSo no flipping but just\nNo flipping or\nNo flipping ?\nno .\nyou wanted the flipping so\nYeah I guess but uh I mean most votes count right ?\nBut if you if you  If you drop it it it just breaks . And it has to be very strong because of the  . Yeah kind of\nIt's shaking .\nYeah .\nThrowing and the kinetics . Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually .\nYeah true true .\nYeah just light on top .\nYeah .\nAnd it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years .\nYeah if you if you're going for the kinetics\nYeah .\nSafer . Mm . Yeah okay that  the target group .\nBut there are more\nUh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes .\nYeah okay . That's true . Okay . Yeah ?\nWell . I just uh ended the meeting .\nYeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also .\nYou two go design .\nOkay wi\nRemember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy .\nOh . By the way . Um\nYeah .\nMaybe we should try something like that . But yeah .\nI uh thought up a name for our product . Yeah . It's called uh the Real Remote .\nOh right .\nYeah ?\nWith a copyright sign after Real .\nOoh .\nAlright .\nThe Real Remote .\nYeah .  Alright .\nYeah . I like it .\nSo maybe you can include that somewhere .\nOkay . This can go .\nGood . Yeah . We should work in our own room right ? Or not ?\nYeah .\nOh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well .\nI don't see any power cables here so\nLet's see .\nYeah . Yes .\nWhat the hell's that ?\n'Kay .\nI think uh it's the sensors .\nSee you two in half an hour uh\nOkay .\nUh\nGood luck .\nYep . Okay that's the side . Ah it's it's okay . But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ?\nYeah . I think we do .\nOr just leave it ? Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button .\nYeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah .\nFor menu . Or\nYeah ? I dunno . We w kind of wanted to stick with the\nYeah . No , yeah .\nYeah I'm just thinking ,  if we i we wanna make something different\nright ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons .\nYeah .\nI think .\nMm .

Um we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . Not a lot thankfully to say . We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . Um . Now . Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required .\nMm .\nUm or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go .\n'Kay .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "teletext, desktop, remote, deskt, functionality", "dialogue_id": 90}, {"text": "So um I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want .\nSure . Um , sh would you like to  I'll just do it from here .\nYep . Sorry . Uh . Is yours the\nUm , try second one maybe . Try it , yeah maybe .\nOh sorry . Okay , right .\nYeah . Okay . Oh , I thought I put in my last name , I guess not , but  .\nUh if you  that's all right . If you  do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ?\nOkay .  Oh yeah , that'd be fine , that'd be great .\nYeah ?\nOkay . Functional requirement by me Ebenezer .\nOkay .\nOkay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . We asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people  fifteen people in each group .\nOkay .\nOkay .  So we got  some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it .  Most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . And if they do , not very often . Takes too long to master the remote control . I've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not great to use . We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . Some of the good stuff we got . Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . Now don't get excited yet , I've got more to say on that . Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that .   Finally , my opinion .\nYep .\nThe voice recognition thing is cool . And uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . It's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you can't have that many words . For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . I'm pretty sure people would buy it . But after a while people may wanna return it , because  if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it .  However ,  oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . See , you could  there're two options . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine .\nOkay , yep .\nSo we have the three birds , we have the design , that  we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition's fancy , it's cool , it's different , it's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit I don't remember  so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question . Um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control .  And uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you . Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . Uh , will people return the remote control ,  I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so ,\nMm-hmm . If you could uh\ndo our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical . So . These are things I think we should consider .\nsor\nI think it's cool ,\nif you could speed it up a bit , yeah . If you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah .\nI'm sorry ? Sure .\nSorry .\nI'm about to end , yeah .\nCool .\nI think it's cool but there are definitely some considerations .\nOkay . Excellent .\nSo , yeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "feedback, presentation, questions, remotes, remote", "dialogue_id": 90}, {"text": "Right . Um . Hear from the  User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea .\nOkay .\nUm , you've got your presentation now ,\nHow did  where did\nYeah , it's in the it's in the folder\nis it on the\nwhere did you get all your in information  ?\nyeah .\nis it ? Okay .\nThere was uh a website , uh ,\nOh .\nTechnical functions ?\nright here .\nAh , okay .\nMm .\nNo . Yeah . Okay .\nOkay , this is a  brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I  had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance , so\nOkay .\npress on . I've looked at  looked at a num  uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . Um and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on .  Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . Um to save you getting off your backside . Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . On the one hand  and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . And most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what  what is most likely to get used . Um  With uh  a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . Um and if you  if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_  D_V_D_ or uh  V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . Um . My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . Um but uh the pro  I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from  want it to do most . So , something that's uh  something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . Um so that those are then immediately  accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp  you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's  going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . Um , this is actually  a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons\nMm .\nthat are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the  and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified . And so it's taking taking the lead from that . Um .\nOkay . Yeah .\nThat's it .\nRight . Um , if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer .\nYeah . Uh , I was still working on stuff , I hadn't got it finished . Um ,  alright . Click to save in  where do I have to save it ?\nIf you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents . If you save it in there we can open it up from here .\nUm , what I've done with it , I'm sorry . Shit . Um\nAre you finding it okay or ?\nI'm just  closing it now .  where I've saved it .\nWell like if you go to one , uh whichever one you were working\nthat's it there ,\nyeah ,\nyeah .\nand you just click file save as .\nOh right .\nOkay .\nUh , right I'm responsible for working design , uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control . So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I've seen . Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . So uh uh , if you go to next slide , you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface . Do we need uh many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not . Um ,  , or would that take too much power , would we need more um components in there to supply the power ? Um , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  , so uh we need to  I dunno exactly what  That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design , um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface .\nOkay .\nSo , that'll be decided , I guess .  Uh , and the next slide . Oh , yeah  Um , if you go to the next slide then .\nOh . Yeah .\nI just used the  it was a mess , uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there . Uh\nAh , don't worry about it at all mate .\nUh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything . You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . Uh , so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? Um , I dunno what we should decide on that .\nOkay . Well . Oh sorry , I'm I'm interrupting you . Are you  is it\nNo , it's finished , yeah .\nyeah ? Okay . Right . Um ,  right we can probably skip that for now . So , we've had some stuff put forward , um along with the new user requirements , um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . Um I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about  um voice activated control . However I've got a couple of worries about that .  The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues .\nCost . Mm .\nUm for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory\nMm-hmm .\nand usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible .\n'Kay .\nUm that's just my view right now ,\nMm .\nhowever the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , but it might be quite low ?\nMm . I uh\nL_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or  uh , interactive L_C_D_ or\nWell literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a  a mobile phone ,\nMm .\nsomething where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around .\nMm-hmm .\nThat could be one possibility . Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels\nMm .  I I was thinking that the remote  the um  sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels .\nWe\nDo you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ?\nUm I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it\nYeah .\num but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing , um . And I think  and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind .\nMm .\nUm though I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white .\nI would agree with you .\nSi si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we .\nMm-hmm .\nIt does nothing extra .\nThat would be my feeling as well , I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . Um now I mean I don't\nSure but the idea of a remote with a menu or  and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one ,\nsorry , go for it .\nbut I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are  niche are we trying to market and corner . You know , you know what I'm saying , like , for whom is this intended ? Everybody ?\nI think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people .\nMost people , yeah .\nMm .\nUm , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . But that does cover a very large section of the people out there .\nMm-hmm . Sure . I think that's fair  yeah .\nMm .\nUm , I mean I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . Which maybe doesn't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it .\nMm-hmm .\nUm and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined .\nMm-hmm .\nSo like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_\nMm-hmm .\nand who would normally use the unit .\nMm .  I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick\nI dunno .\nMm-hmm .\nis that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone , you could put um I mean there are  like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . You can pack all that onto was onto a single control . Um .\nMm-hmm .\nBut uh but the  but then o uh obviously if uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i  you you then get to sort of menu navigation . I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and  fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra\nMm-hmm .\nintegrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling . Um  concern about our market . Um , if we are I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of  remote control rationalisation . Um , you've got twenty different devices in your living room ,\nYeah . Mm-hmm .\nyou want one wo  y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . Um , if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else .\nMm-hmm .\nI just think that uh possibly\nWell this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid ,\nmm .\nthis isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on .\nMm .\nSo um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now .\nMm .\nSo I can understand your point , and I would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now . 'Fraid to say . Um\nDoes that um would that include um access to say  interactive functions on digital or cable ?\nYeah .\nI would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . Um I think that it  I would say that the design spec we've been  with is for the television only for now .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd until we hear otherwise we should go with just that .\nHmm . Okay , specifically television .\nOkay .\nOkay . Maybe we'll hear differently , but for now\nSo the joystick is just for differentness .\nMm .\nIt would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes . Um\nOkay .\nJust a thought .  Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers , rather than the public . Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um\nThere is that possibility , yes . B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert ,\nMm .\nthat might be sales , who are not in this meeting .\nMm-hmm . It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that ,\nMm-hmm .\nnot to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , you know , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls .\nMm-hmm .\nWe just  Is this gonna be enough to to sell ?\nWell , something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you've done , in fact we've probably all done .\nYeah .\nUm , I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you  tell you where it is .\nMm , yeah , I've seen them .\nI had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up\nUm . Well\nbecause it it went off all the time accidentally .\nthe other option of course is that um the\nThe clapping one .\nwell  I was going to say clapping , um  Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has  of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ .\nMm .\nTo a television .\nSomething which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit .\nYeah .\nYeah , I think that's a good idea .\nAnd that could be something could um separate us a bit .\nYeah , that's a good idea .\nAnd that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't  power  that might be something that we could look into .\nYeah\nYep . Yeah , it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well .\nI think so , yeah .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remotes, remote, controls, interactive, functionality", "dialogue_id": 90}, {"text": "So . To go on from here . Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going  this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique .\nMm .\nDo we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ .\nMm yeah . Yeah , I think that's\nWe're just saying volume . Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ?\nYeah .\nWe could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume ,\nFor volume .\nand\nBut we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most .\nYep .\nOkay .\nUm , power is used like once per hour ,\nI\nchannel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour ,\nMm-hmm .\nthat's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen ,\nVol Volume selection okay , yep ,\nand volume selection .\nthe teletext we're gambling with , and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo\nNo , yeah , okay okay . Yeah , um\nSo we  well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? So we're having very very few buttons involved ,\nActually how\nbut navigation around a menu for most things .\nActually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the  y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay .\nOkay .\nOr vice versa .\nOkay .\nAnd that's really irritating .\nMm-hmm .\nThe o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , um , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb .\nOkay . So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ?\nYeah , think so .\nDo you mind looking  ?\nUm , I think because it's so small it might be an uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that\nThe ability to locate it again .\nYeah .\nSo that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and  what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base .\nLight bulb as well ,\nOh . So  so\nno ?\nSorry ?\na small speaker you mean .\nSome speaker ,\nSpeaker\nsorry , yeah .\nyeah .\nAnd a light bulb ? No . To flash . No .\nUm\nNah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it .\nE us we might be better with the sound possibly  we could maybe incorporate\nW those little key-rings have both ,\nYeah .\nth e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway .\nso  Yeah .\nThe L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm . Blue ones particularly .\nUm .  So\nPlus that's a nice wee design touch .\nYeah .\nby the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design .\nMm-hmm .\nBecause we're only going to have a very few key and you've got you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly .\nMm-hmm .\nUm if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of um small transmitter , um and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such . Ebenezer , um , Marketing Expert\nWell I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , right .\nIf ,\nYou want the stuff  .\nyeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile .\nOkay .\nI don't know how easy that will be within the time frame ,\nOkay .\nbut could be something we could maybe look into .\nMm-hmm . Sure . Sure .\nOkay . Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? Anything that they think has been missed out . Bit of a wide open question there of course .\nMm .\nFeel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible .\nSure . 'Kay . Yeah .\nRight .\nSo I should just look at um the speaker ,  the speaker and an L_E_D_ .\nSpeaker and L_E_D_ for locating , um ,\nAnd\nTransmitter  .\nYeah , and a transmitter .\ntransmitter\nActually one one wee thought about that . Um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television .\ngetting the external power source , yep , that's quite true . Um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say .\nYeah .\nThe electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control ,\nMm-hmm .\nso that's good .\nMm-hmm .  You know I think\n'Kay .\nI mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales . Quite quickly .\nP\nOh , one thing that we've almost not talked about at all , my apologies for that , um , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , um it's ,\nFashion .\nI'm pointing at my laptop , what in God  Real reaction , and such . So um\nThe slogan is\nOh , sorry .\nyeah , the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , isn't it ?\nMy apologies . No it could well be , I've probably missed that . Um , I think that's l almost the last minute thing\n'S also look cool .\nwe can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top .\nMm .\nSo I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ?\nMm-hmm .\nIn fact we might like to put a slogan on , and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company . Rather than real reaction .\nMm-hmm . Mm . Yeah . I thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button .\nSounds good .\n.\nAnd I'd say that that's us for now .

Sorry I'm a little late .\nNo problem .\nGot stuck in the traffic .\nOkay .\nThat's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh\nYeah .\nUh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting . There he is . Yes . Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money .\nAnd this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda . We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria .  Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that .\nWe've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um we will do the  this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward .\nOkay . Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors . Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . Then there's the zero to  one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .\nOkay .\nUm ,  is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?\nSo  Yeah . Yeah .\nSure uh just pop in at any time .\nUm , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .\nUh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh  So um  You put it uh  you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd you  But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So\nOkay . Okay . Um  Yeah .\nOkay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons .\nOh yeah ?\nBut uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . So I'm wondering if we if we neely  really need all of those buttons .\nI think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this .\nThat's right .\nYeah .\nAnd well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYou can't drop that one . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those .\nYeah .\nThe mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary\nYeah yeah .\nbecause there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .\nMm .\nUh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh\nLong time . Yeah .\nYeah .\nIf you put\nBut m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put  press uh the button and uh\nYeah . Okay .\nWell ,  you can't leave out the number buttons I guess .\nYeah .\nAnd uh\nUh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary .\nAnd\nOh .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nSo it's rather basic already .\nYeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here .\nYep .\nYeah .\nOkay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ?\nYeah , they're\nJust n normal plain buttons .\nYeah . Yeah ,\nIt's rather hard to draw on the white-board .\nit\nBut they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff .\nYeah . 'Kay .\nYeah yeah . Just to recognise it , so uh\nJust for recognition .\nUh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um  Y uh\nNo .\ns some uh remote controls uh do it also ,\nNo .\nbut um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so\nYeah . Okay .\nSo and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case .\nNay .\nYep .\nSo they jump out .\nOkay .\nAnd uh that's about it .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "design, budget, prototype, presentation, usability", "dialogue_id": 91}, {"text": "That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .\nMm .\nIf we see  I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible .\nSince it rechargeable .\nIt's rechargeable . That's right .\nYeah we can u just uh\nOkay . That's two Euros off .\n'Kay .\nWe need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh  to save there .\nYep .\nHere we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um ,\nMm .\nI don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control .\nYeah .\nI think we have to keep that .\nYes .\nYeah .\nThen we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons . So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low .\nOkay .\nBecause you have to  we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um ,\nYeah .\nso if we  Let's fir first count the buttons we have now .\nUh  Sixteen , I believe so .\nBecause I   Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros . So ,\nUh seventeen . Uh with the help button .\nseventeen .\nUm\nOkay , including the help ?\nYep .\nDamn .\nYeah . Uh seventeen .\nYeah .\nI think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long .\n.\nYep .\nThat saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?\nYeah .\nWouldn't\nFifteen buttons .\nYeah . No . That wouldn't be an option .\nAnd this is\nUh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?\nNo those are one , I think .\nYeah . Where did uh\nWell , think actually there're two buttons ,\nUh , it's just one button .\naren't they ?\nBut , um  Yeah . There were uh two uh for one big button . But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . Uh , yeah . So\nYeah but th it's not stated in this files .\nIt's just a  .\nSo maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing\nWell I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .\nThat's possibility as well .\nThat would cut the cost .\nSo  And it's good for the design as well . So you can make  Uh let's see . If you make this   Looks a bit like uh a cross .  Plus . Min .\nBut I don't don't know if if it's cheaper .\nUh s yeah channel .\nSo uh ,\nYeah w\nwe've still got four buttons , but just um  So\nYeah th I think they count uh the materials .\nYou got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um\nYeah on the chip there . Yeah .\nYeah . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nThat's right . That's right .\nSo\nBut I think because we have the advanced chip\nYeah .\nwe can just count this as one button .\nYeah , but\nBut , I think this really is four buttons anyhow .\nBut  No but I think\nYes .\nYeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use .\nYes .\nUh that's that's a big cost .\nI think they uh try t\nIf we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .\nThat's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ?\nOnly the docking station , I guess .\nYeah .\nWhich isn't the  the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic .\nNo .\nSo it's not even taken into the price .\nThat's extra .  That's extra . That's right .\nMaybe we should to a different supplier .\nThat's an option .\nYeah .\nPoland . Something .  Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well .\nWe we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?\n.\nYeah , that's what I'm wondering .\nMy mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message .\nYeah . That's a point .\nSo\nAre we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ?\nUm\nSo um  Yeah . We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or  Can't uh go um\nYep .\nYeah .\nNo .\nWell , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features .\nNay .\nYeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it .\nIs it impossible to\nThe margin will get too small . Yeah .\nYeah . So\nBut it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .\nIt is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say  Or you can take the single chip .\nI don't think so .\nIt would be a be a pretty rigid one .\nS Yeah .\nBut , you can't use uh\nTen .\nThere it is .\nYeah .\nBut then w Good looking .\nUh , wi with n Oh , with uh attractive uh o options .\nYeah .\nSo uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So\nI think it's uh difficult as well ,\nOr b\nbut\nBasically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .\nNo remote .\nOr we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . Then w\nScroll-wheel's one .\nThat's\nBecause then we save ten buttons .\nNo , it\nThen we have five and one .\nYeah .\nAnd and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced  W uh , we're getting close .\nWe're getting closer .\nYeah .\nBut how does scroll-wheel work here ?\nThen you will  Or maybe you can um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it .\nYeah .\nThat would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button .\nAlright . It's gotta scroll and push .\nMm .\nOkay but then you you can push uh some other button as well .\nBut  Yeah .\nYou could just not scroll for a half a second .\nYeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel .\nSo you won't need a button .\nI think that would be like the end of our usability .\nBut it would definitely crop cost , a lot .\nD yeah .\nYeah , but\nAnd we need the battery .  And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ?\nIf you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .\nIt has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay .\nHmm .\nAnd we can save a Euro by a flat design . That's an option we can\nJa ja .\nYep .\nThen we're almost there .\nYeah if you v could just leave out one more button .\nYeah . So if we\nYeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button .\nYeah .\nYeah but I think that's  That is a big advantage ,\nSo  Yeah\nif we're\nYeah it's a big advantage .\nBut\nBut um , it's\nCan we use  can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?\nUh , yeah .\nI think so . Yeah .\nIf you push it three times ?\nWell , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are\nYeah .\nright now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there .\nBut if you push the teletext button twice\nWhat if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight .\nI think that's the case on most\nIt's uh  One m uh one b uh , a few buttons .\nAh that's not really that\nWell , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .\nYeah . Okay .\nBut then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people ,\nNo .\nwho don't even know what a scroll-wheel is .\nYeah .\nNo .\nHolding a remote with  which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .\nWith only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel .\nI think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . If you just make it real simple . Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .\nTrue . True .\nHmm .\nAnd it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . Mm eraser ? And we put uh  Looks a bit odd maybe .\nThat's a pretty big scroll wheel .\nThat is   Something like that .\nThen , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . And these are two buttons then .\nWe could make two buttons out of that . And just um  If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .\nYeah .\nSo that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel .\nYeah . That's really a good good idea , I think . And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed .\nMore obvious .\nSo we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . That's right .\nSo if we\nSo we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . That's m that's better .\nYeah .\nYeah . So\nSo this is five buttons .\nIf we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall .\nY yeah .\nSo if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button\nMm yeah . Uh yeah , and then you can\nyou get a a much smaller remote .\nThat's right .\nUh yeah .\nAnd it sh\nSo we can decrease this one to four buttons .\nYeah ?\nRight now we have five .\nBut uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one .\nYeah . That's no problem .\nJust uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh\nYeah . Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in .\nMm .\nAnd cases come right out of the machine .\n.\nAnd single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . I think this is a really easy one . Um , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ?\nWell , I still think we should go for the single curve design .\n.\nYeah .\nBut then again ,  all these changes are not really okay with me .\nRichard's argument was very good . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYep .\nBut since we just have to .\nWe have to cut costs .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah I'm ag\nI'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend  eighteen dollars a a remote .\nAsk for more money . Yeah . Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah .\nOr do some market research and see what the options are .\nYeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more .\nYep .\nYeah .\nSo people will use it more , and especially for the help functions ,\nYeah .\nit will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well . So this is scroll . I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier .  Before we went on to the to the whole design .\nYes . Definitely .\nThe th\nBut  I'm glad we could make a bit .\nYeah .\nIt's pretty different , if you saw the last one than  this one .\nIt's pretty different .\nBut this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .\nNo .\nThis will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .\nYeah . It will . Yeah .\nBut um\n'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them .\nNo , but I think\nSo we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .\nI think the most\nBut they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels .\nThat's right .\nYeah .\nWe can let l\nSo maybe it's uh\nWe can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMaybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one .\nYeah .\nSo , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh  But we will see .\nYeah .\nThat's true . Might uh  might be confusing too .\nYeah . That's definitely right .\nMm-hmm .\nThey'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ?\nYeah .\nBut very special , so uh\nI would buy it .\nYeah . But you're not sixty .\nThat's right . I would buy it if I was six .  No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ?

Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . The target group .

Seven .\nYeah .\nSeven ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ?\nShould be do-able .\nYeah . That's right .\nIs the design easy to use ?\nMm . Not really .\nThat's a bit dodgy .\nWell  Would be for us . But\nFor old people I I\nI would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five .\nW\nFour or five . Yes .\nYeah . Four .\nI'd go for four , too .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nIs it functional ?\nIs the design functional ? Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ?\nYes .\nN Yeah .\nI think we do . Do we have too many functions ?\nNo .\nNo .\nNo .\nI don't think so . It's pretty slim .\nThink it's uh seven .\nSeven . Oh , and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and  R_S_I_ influences ?\nMm m\nMm , we haven't thought of that one .\nIt was .\nThink we do .\nI had them worked out . Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .\nYeah .\nAre the production costs within the preset limits ?\nWell they are now .\nYeah .\nDoes the design fit the group of focus ?\nMm , th yeah .\nI think that's a three .\nYeah .\nNo I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh I think it's better .\nI think it doesn't .\nYeah . Uh  We have to test it s But\nI don't know .\nI still  I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy .\nI think\nI think it\nI think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .\nUh , yeah , true .\nYeah . I would give it a four .\nI'm not sure . I think I'd go for two .\nI go for three . So\nThen we have to do the three . It's the\n'Kay . Is the company company recognisable ?\nYes it is .\nYeah yeah .\nWell , we have the logo there .\nYeah .\nSo\nAnd they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . And we have the removable front cases . So , I think it's very recognisable .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYep .\nSo that will be this . I was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this .\nWe've got a calculate it . Mm ?\nTwendag sieven an twendag .\nIs this  Like after this , are we done ? Or\nN We've gonna  We're going to evaluate it .\nWe're gonna go to our other room again . Well , anyhow . These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ? No .\nForty nine .\nNine ? Uh , minus one . Minus three , minus four .  Minus four . So that would be minus eight . Forty one out of forty nine .\nForty one . That's  Around eighty percent .\nOkay .\nWhat is it ?\nGuess I'll just type that in on the bottom here .\nThat's eighty four percent . I think that's a pretty nice score .\nHmm . Yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nHmm . 'Kay . So that will be the evaluation .\nThank you . So , that brings us to the project evaluation . Yep . Thank you .\nProject process . Did we move through the right phases , you think ?  Along the process ?\nYes .\nYeah . But it\nThink we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase .\nYeah .\nThat's right . So lack of information about prices .\nYeah .\nYeah . That's true .\nYeah . Definitely .\nOkay . Uh  Okay . Satisfaction . Was there room for creativity ?\nNo .\nNo ?\nNot too much .  No .\nIt's because of the finance sheet . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh\nYeah , true . But\nThe room was  Yeah .\nYeah .\nAnd I would've liked to go for the younger users also .\n.\nAnd just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .\nMm .\nRestrictions . Internet access . 'Kay . Leadership . Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ?\nYeah .\nYes .\nYeah .\nTeamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you  two of you with the uh last phase ?\nSo\nYes , was okay .\nYeah .\nNice .\nThe tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\ntasks . Okay . Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? Or were they too much ?\nMm .\nWell , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but  The digital the digital pen is very nice .\nSmart-board .\nYeah .\nIf it wants to download its uh data .\nBut\nYeah . Yeah .\nYes . Yeah .\nUh\nFailed download . Smart-board was irritating .  So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ?\nYeah .\nA flip-over or a more precise uh digit\nA flipper's uh easier , so  Yeah .\nFaster as well , I think .\nYeah .\nYes .\nYeah . Flip-over .\nBut if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh\nYeah .\nyou can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory .\nYeah ,\nSo  So\nI tried to open the file on my laptop ,\nYeah ? No ?\nNo . Didn't work .\nbut  not possible .\nUh you need a smart board uh application I think .\nYeah .\nBut I think you can\nT can uh can you export it uh like a  Yeah .\nYeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image .\nno .\nMust  Yeah must be\nShould've done that then .\nSo the sharing of the information was uh was okay ?\n.\nPen is here .\nUh , network .\nUh  .\nYes .\nYeah , pen is here on the table .\nUh , yeah . So you can  Uh\nYeah .  It's possible .\nIt's possible .\nMm . Yeah .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nThat's nice . Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? Or\nUm , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh  Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev\nYeah .\nUm it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh\nYeah . So  Yeah . So everybody puts his own score .\nSo\nMm-hmm .\nAnd then  it mediates the score ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand you can get one\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThat's better . So that's uh  How do we call ? Evaluation criteria . Okay . Mm , any more ideas ? Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ?\nMm .\nBecause I think then that we get to our last sheet . Are the costs within the budget ?\nMm yeah .\nYeah .\nThey are .\nConsidering we are not going to make a docking station .\nDo we  Docking station . That's a good point .\n.\nBut maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ?\nYeah .\nUh and I think you can compensate that as well .\nPerhaps .\nMm .\nSo I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well .\nMm-hmm .\nDo we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ?\nYeah .\nOr what was it ?\nFifty grand .\nFifteen fifteen million . I think we will .  If we gonna export this product . It's innovative .\nYeah .\nEspecially in America . People are pretty decadent . Sometimes .\nYeah . Mm .\nYeah .\nYeah , still I think  I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people .\nYou can do more . Yeah .\nAh .\nSo maybe we should just re-focus .\nJust put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .\nAh .\nOr specifically for younger people .\nThat's one thing you can change it with .\nAh .\nThat's true .\nSo you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage .\nYeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . Even if it were their covers .\nYeah . Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now .\nHmm .\nBut\nThat's it .\nParty party .\nYeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think .\nWhere's the champagne ?\n'Kay .\nI don't know . I didn't get a message from the from ending of the\nUh , I believe y uh\nOh I think I have one now .\nOh you did .\nFive more minutes ? Oh that's nice .\nOkay .\nThen we still have some questions . If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . Or we can put these in the project folder as well . Maybe that's\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nExport as picture , I think .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nHmm . This is another network , I guess . Does somebody see the project folder ?\nI don't . Hmm . My Documents .\nUh maybe uh they will save it .

Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .\nUh .\nToo great for email then .\nOkay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .\nYeah .\nUh I I will focus on user interface design .\nMm .\nUm so move to the next slide . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very  has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . There's a lot of functions . Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? Um , let's move to next slide . Um . Yeah . So I  so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide .\nSo my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller  which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So\nThat's the end of the talk  the end of the presentation .\nSo you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .\nUh  With sophisticated functions ,\nSo powerful ,\nbut with very  yeah powerful .\nmany functions and very easy to use .\nYes . Yep .\nSo , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both ,\nTo merge the two system huh .\nI mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYou mean this one ?\nYeah .\nYeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .\nMm yep .\nBut But this is\nBut if we have very very good user interface\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nand then\nit take less time for user to learn how to use it .\nYeah .\nYeah you  maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are  or almost the same , so the sign .\nOh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?\nYeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same .\nOh it should  okay , yeah . The user should know .\nSo you have to  The sh the user there  for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that  So .\nYeah um such as maybe the\nYeah . So .\nGo on , go back and\nYeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .\nYeah , that's gonna be the trick .\nYeah , that's my job .\nThat's your job\nThat's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to .\nIt you\nSo , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use .\nYep .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nPowerful and easy to use .\nSo that's the point .\nYeah , that's the point .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "presentations, presentation, meeting, designer, meetings", "dialogue_id": 92}, {"text": "So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .\nOkay , okay .\nSo you you're\nParticipant two . Yeah .\nUm . Okay .\nThe rationale must be  design , or\nSo , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay .\nSo we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the\nMm-hmm .\nhow to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based\nMm .\nbut  I propose a nifra infrared base  you know , so so for me I think that it is better  it's bet it's better to control T_V_\nso you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know  For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to\nTrue .\nSo you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?\nI think it's cheaper than laser , so  .\nOkay .\nYeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen ,\nWhat the cost is ?\nyeah . The cost\nTwelve , twelve a half .\nYeah , I think for the cost we want  for the cost we want   it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here\nMm-hmm .\nand the bulb it will be somewhere inside .\nThat might just  So .\nYou can go to the next slide .\nOkay .\nI have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff\nYeah .\nyou know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .\nWhat is this ?\nThis is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .\nOkay .\nLook . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and  .\nOkay .\nSo and the next slide , it is the last one it's  So it's  I think it should be wire  wireless re remote con  Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nOkay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?\nWhat's the average price of this technology then ?\nWell the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the\nSo what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire  with remote control ?\nYou'd  yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .\nOkay .\nSo you think that uh  a cable between the remote control  and the T_V_   won't be a good idea .\nOkay . Okay .\nNo it wou maybe it will be cheaper  I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu\nBut this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a\nYeah ,\nWireless remote control  .\nbut\nI don't think  well , yeah , I don't think he would ,\nYeah , but some pa I always want to have you know ,\nbut in a sense\nsometime I want to have wire because you know .\nYeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?\nI'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?\nUh ,  I don't  think it will be too much .\nCould you answer please ?\nOkay .\nHave to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's  I think that you know you can always you know\nOkay .\nI think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .\nYeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .\nMm-hmm .\nThe wire ?\nAs it's  yeah .\nYeah . True .\nOkay , yeah .\nI think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .\nMm-hmm .\nUh that's my job . That's the\nOkay ,  I'm sorry .\nNow the\nSo\nYeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because  even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the  the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use ,  so  it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .\nSo\nOkay .\njust think of um the usability .\nDesign a wireless remote control .\nYeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI think it's would be easier to have  a link between the remote control and the television ,\nWell that's actually one of the point , yeah ?

So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide .\nSorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's\nYou mean the loo the look , the outside ?\nThe look , how it look like .\nYeah , the the look is is bad for them\nOkay .\nso uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly .

And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so  doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh ,\nMm-hmm .\nremote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .\nSo this is from the experiments we've done ,\nso if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .\nWhat is R_S_I_ ?\nR_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um  doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .\nYeah .\nAh um okay .\nOkay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,\nFunctions .\nthis would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay .\nOkay .\nSo\nMm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?\nYeah .\nSure ? Yeah ?\nYeah , I think possible . Because we can  We can uh mix uh several function in one button .\nYeah .\nSo lets you  then you have less buttons .\nYeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?\nBut I'm not sure\nBecause if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .\nYeah , remember the user is not happy to read the\nThe manuals .\nYeah ,\nmanual .\nI think the\nIt's\nNo you you can have a switch menu , so you can\nYeah , but it has to be intuitive .\nwell for example  Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions .\nYeah , okay . Okay ,\nThen you you put the switch button ,\nbut\nthen it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .\nWith a\nSo there's a different functions , but i if you you  there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons .\nYeah , but\nBut what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny  look fancy , not funny .\nLook fancy .\nThis is a question that should be asked to the  If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people  .\nBecause different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .\nYeah .\nYeah , this is something we sh\nBecause maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some  for other peoples , so .\nMm-hmm .\nBut this was first step and  This was the first step , yeah .\nI think the solution is to have many colours of  you know instead of having one grey standard\nYeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .\nSpecially distribution , yeah .\nYeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .\nIf you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .\nUh\nYeah , personalised colour . Because you know\nYeah , it will cost little bit more .\nYeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control ,\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nsome people prefer black remote control .\nYeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .\nAnd also f\nMaybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,\nYeah .\nso user can select which colour they prefer , so .\nYeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases ,\nYeah ,\nMm-hmm .\nremember it's twelve Euros .\nand we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .\nMm-hmm .\nHmm .\nAnd they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .\nMm-hmm .\nSo  I think you have quite lot of points to to think about\nYeah .\nand to discuss it with uh the other members .\nYeah , hmm .\nYeah .\nSo , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?\nYeah , it's done , just  yeah . If we would  if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .\nMm-hmm . Okay . Mm so\nSo .\nSo , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's\nMm-hmm .\nIt's is uh\nLame , or\nNo yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nSo , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control ,\nYep .\nand also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not  you won't be uh  you won't had  um buttons to just to manipulate  yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .\nControl . Mm-hmm .\nIt's\nMm-hmm\nbecause if we want to to do remote control\nMm .\nwhich will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?\nOkay . But there's balance between function and the cost .\nSo maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .\nYeah . Okay .\nAnd also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nI mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .\nMm-hm .\nMm-hmm .\nSo you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um\nOkay .\nof the uh of real reaction\nOkay .\nSo .\nand uh also\nSo has to be yellow .\nYellow .\nYeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .\nOkay . Mm-hmm .\nRequire lot of requirements ,\nFor cheap  remote control , yeah .\nbut\nYeah . And cheap .\nYeah .\nA low cost .\nYeah . But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .\nYeah  . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .\nThis is\nI don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway .\nMaybe not ,\nIt's maybe more in browsing .\nbut mayb\nYeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .\nYeah , there's that box in uh o of it .\nYeah .\nA pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .\nOkay .\nOk\nHm-mm .\nIt's It's not so uh popular now .\nIt's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know\nMm .\nthe global usage ,\nGlobal ,\nso if people don't have the technology .\nokay .\nSo .\nMm-hmm .\nSo everybody is okay with the new requirements ?\nSo I I so  As as for the colour , what what do you think ?\nI think it has to be yellow .\nYellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ?\nYeah .\nYellow ?  T_V_ remote control ?\nMin\nMaybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .\nOkay . Okay .\nYeah .\nI think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be .\nWhy you go  It has to be fashion .\nYeah , so .

Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so .\nOkay , okay . Okay .\nAnd also it has to be attractive , of course ,\nMm .\nbecause if you want to sale  to sell the remote control . It's okay ?\nRegarding the first line , what  So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .\nYeah .\nAnd that's it .\nYeah .\nBut  I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me .\nIt's already changed for\nI think it would be simpler .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay . So  I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . Uh  Y you  You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um  pon\nIndustrial Designer .\nIndustrial Designer , yeah . Component component , yeah .\nyeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .\nOkay .\nAnd Florent to work my subject .\nYep .\nAnd so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\nOkay .\nIt's okay ?\nYeah .\nI think the um session is closed .\nGood .\nAnd by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder .

So I'll discuss them with you .\nOkay , we're just going to the  later .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah , I received an email as well .\nSo we're going to talk about the conceptual model .\nOh .\nHmm .\nWhich one was mine ?\nSo that's me .\nUh okay .

Whatever .\nThe minutes .\nOkay , so we just talked about uh  Oh you want me to show that there or\nNo ,\nMm no .\nUh\nOkay ,\njust tell us .\nwe just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um  It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . That right ?\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYes .\nSo I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your\nShall I start ?\nYeah .\nNo . Okay well  I received an email  Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following .  The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh  This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .\nHmm .\nBut um  this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .\nBut we already have the flashing flashing light on the\nUh maybe maybe something new .\nYeah , more .\nHmm .\nWe have to discuss about it s uh  Okay , uh\nOkay .\nWell , I'll I'll get back on it .\nfeatures not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .\nYeah .\nSo I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari  uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes .\nHmm .\nBut the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .\nSpongy .\nBut spongy , what what does spongy says ?\nSpongy .\nSpongy , like sponge .\nSpongy . Okay .\nSo rubber , kind of .\nUh soft materials .\nBut maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,\nYeah .\nbecause you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be  flexible .\nYeah , but  Yeah .\nYeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah .\nIt's like a sponge .\nSoft , sponge .\nSo it's also a stress-ball .\nThat's a good  That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea .\nYeah , somewhat like\nYeah , but  Yeah .\nIs it a bit like like the the the the  remote control ?\nHow are you gonna make it ?\nR_ soft .\nYeah ,\nUh\nI've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .\nOkay .\nOkay ?\nWhat do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .\nYeah .\nUh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot .\nAnd uh some basic uh colour fronts .  Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .  Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .\nYeah .\nJust uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh  Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget .\nYeah , I'll get back on that .\nHmm .\nSo\nIt's very uh difficult to to to do it .\nIntro\nBecause it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .\nYeah .\nWell ,\nYeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem .\nI got f also an email from the the technology department .\nSo  Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .\nThey have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it .\nOkay .\nWell\nHmm .\nOkay .\nI'll check what they exact mean .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "wake, bonjour, conceptual, model, minutes", "dialogue_id": 93}, {"text": "Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .\nSo uh\nYeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap\nYeah ,\nand it's easy to implement .\nth that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so  Um but uh\nif we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .\nOh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can\nSince you have to uh configure speech thing .\nBut that's definitely more expensive than\nYeah , that's that's something I dunno .\nYeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be  .\nYeah , but a telephone   Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .\nYeah , so uh we gotta de\nSo uh\nWe have to decide on that .\nYeah . Okay . That was this ?\nMm uh\nOh I got an email uh  And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And  Um  They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So\nL_D_C_ doesn't require\nit's m the most expensive . Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip .\nOkay . And speech recognition ?\nYeah , probably too .\nAdvanced  . Yeah .\nI I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but\nI'll I'll give you my design .\nWell it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .\nYeah okay . So we   Well we can  I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um  This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .\nYeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .\nMore modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out  both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so\nHmm .\nIt's the most important part , I think . But  And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .\nYeah , maybe the teletext tel\nYeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,\nNo .\nbut it's\nNo , I don't uh  I don't like it .\nUh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So\nHmm .\nand then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten .  And I think\nBut it  That's on on the display .\nNo no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .\nYeah .\nSo the focus is on these two parts .\nYeah .\nSo you don't see all the buttons you else need .\nBut it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .\nUh well um\nSo you can't use your thumb for it .\nThis is how it is now . Um  Here uh  Well we have volume .\nYeah ,\nI think it is on uh on the bottom too .\ndown there . But it's not not the best best .\nYeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use\nYeah , okay .\nYeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel .\nYeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .\nYeah , why not .\nFor volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more .\nScroll .\nBy just putting the volume on the side .\nAnd the channels as well .\nAnd and just channel buttons here .\nOh yeah .\nBut I think uh\nYeah , or uh maybe uh  The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .\nWell . Yeah , well it's  Basically it's it's here .\nYeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .\nYeah , that's better .\nThey're on top ?\nYeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom .\nBecause uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .\nYou mean uh these to the low ?\nMm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button .\nOh okay . Well , yeah .\nBut I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom .\nMm  Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll\nLike zapping is just switching one channel at a time .\nYeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to  . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .\nYeah okay .\nAnd uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh  you don't see 'em very good .\nThat's that's good , but\nI think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .\nYeah okay .\nBut uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .\nYeah .\nSo we can uh switch these to\nHmm .\nI dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .\nNo , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top .\nOkay . Yeah , maybe\nBut uh we we can switch those two ,\nThose two , yeah .\nyeah .\nAnd uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh  Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right .\nOkay .\nWell that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we  I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .\nYeah . Yeah , that's cool .\nTo use\nYeah .\nSo if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think .\nOkay .\nNo .\nSo that's something we have to decide on .\nYeah , we have to keep it simple .\nWe have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .\nYeah .

I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not  Nothing square-like .\nOkay , so  Hmm , okay .\nYeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved  square .\nYeah .\nSquare . Like .\nYeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think .\nOkay . So not\nSo we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .\nYeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look .\nYeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of\nYeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the  remote control .\nlooking , I think .\nMm .\nOkay .\nSo the colours also .\nMm   Yeah , it's\nSo we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .\nBlack yellow control .\nYeah .\nMaybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .\nYeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .\nYeah , but uh  I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But\nWe make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .\nNo , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but\nYeah , okay .\nWe have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .\nUh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So\nYeah , it's cool . Yep .\nYeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue\nAnd still trans\nYes .\nStill still transparent .\nSo\nand\nOh yeah .\nYeah . But with all with logo on it .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nWell this is a remote control , a very old one . Um   Then the components . The case has just a  Here's black .\nYeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure .\nYeah , I dunno .\nYeah .\nMaybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ?\nWell one of the options .\nS\nYou can  Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .\nOkay .\nSo you can just replace them I think . That was the idea ,\nYeah , we could do that .\nor just uh release one .\nYeah . Just give five with them , just in a box .  Five different\nYeah , uh  Or just uh sell different ones .\nYeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .\nYeah . Cool .\nSo you can still th look through it .\nYeah . Yeah .\nUm the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nI uh I dunno .\nIt it could be like a Nokia , like  plastic .\nA more  Yeah , just uh\nUh uh\nThat's better prob\nWith the hard hard buttons .\nYeah .\nI think uh rubber really has an odd look .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the  uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .\nYeah .\nIt it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't  Is  uh a button uh um   How do you say it ?\nYeah , it's it's all on one level .\nIt it didn't it i it don't come out of the  on the background .\nYeah , on one level .\nIt is in uh the c a remote control uh\nYeah .\nYeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nlike mobile phones . Like uh the iPod .\nYeah .\nUh just\nYeah , okay .\nYeah , that's cool .\nOkay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ?\nI dunno what uh kind of material it is .\nI think . Or maybe\nBut\nYeah .\nBut maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh\nOops .\nbasic remote control from normal plastic ,\nand\nYeah .\nthe rounds of it from softer s\nOkay .\nYeah .\nAnd um   Then the L_E_D_ .\nI dunno .\nThe normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s .\nY\nYeah .\nSo\nCool .\nBut I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work .\nYeah .\nSo if you put\nY i if you  The numbers could be can be\nUh you can just make them around the buttons uh\nYeah , that's right .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOr it runs the whole\nYeah , but we can still make it transparent . So\nThey can choose .\nYeah , you can halfs transparent ,\nOr no\nor just that it's comes out a bit .\nYeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights\nDifferent , I think , also .\nor\nBlue .\nYeah ?\nBlue or red .\nWhatever you want it , I think .\nYeah .\nUh depends on the colour of the\nYeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it .\nUh i\nYou have to choose\nYeah , that's true . But\nNo , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So\nIs it  Okay .\nYeah ,\nI I know  I dunno . Is\nbut can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ?\nYeah , it can .\nYeah , okay .\n'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well .\nYou\nMaybe it's it's more impor more expensive .\nMaybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just  No , just some LED .\nI have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone .\nI think it's\nAnd I can change the colour of it .\nOkay , cool .

So\nHmm .\nThen uh some more technical things .\nI don't know what it is , but it should be there  I think .\nUm this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .\nYeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so\nW  So we d we just need this and  this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .\nUm they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .\nI'm sure we can fit in .\nSo I guess we j we just need that .\nYeah .\nI don't know what they do or\nYeah okay .\nOkay yeah ,\nWe just\nyou can you can change  Yeah . No .\nNah , but they just said we need it .\nOkay .\nUh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .\nYeah , a recharger maybe .\nYeah , we have to make sure to uh\nYeah okay .\nWe still want to have a recharger , don't we ?\nYeah but\nIs that still the\nYes . Yes .\nYeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an  How do you call it ? Accu .\nA recha Oh no . Uh  Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah .\nRe recharger .

Not a separate\nNo , just rechargeable batteries .\nOkay . And uh a chip , that's this one .\nThen uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh  Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda .\nAh cool . Okay .\nBut normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .\nSo if you hold it , it gets powered .\nIf you hold it . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and  Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors ,\nIt's dark in the room . No .\nIt's just batteries ,\nso\nthat's cheaper  .\nYeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .\nYeah .\nUm cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth .\nOkay .\nSo that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .\nMm . So\nSo we can't use the flat buttons .\nwe need uh two D_ .\nYeah . Definitely .\nYeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used .\nBut it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic .\nYeah .\nYeah , I think so too .\nThe scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume .\nYeah , scroll wheels um\nYeah .\nYeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .\nYeah .\nBut I think just the volume is enough .\nUh  For channels it's not handy ,\nOkay .\nbecause you scroll too fast .\nAnd uh the L_C_D_ . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ .\nMm\nI don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .\nOkay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels .\nYeah , okay .\nOkay .\nAnd um  Yeah , that was it I guess .\nOkay .\nUh are are we using a a rubber case , or\nOh just sk\nWe haven't decided yet .\nMaybe you have to skip that one as well . It's\nUh I don't think a rubber case looks\nL\nUh but we have to do something about the trend .\nYeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ?\nThe trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .\nYeah , okay . That  Uh fruit and veg , or\nAnd uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .\nYeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers .\nUh yeah i Just  Just on front .\nSo you can  the the spongy  yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control .\nNo .\nNeith uh I don't like it uh neither .\nNo .\nI just can't imagine it .\nSo just hard plastic ?\nYeah .\nYeah , I think .\nOkay .\nTitanium . It's mentioned here uh .\nTitanium , uh I think it's too expensive .\nBut maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit\nYeah ,\nmore rounded .\nyou can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth .\nYeah . Yeah , that's right .\nOkay .\nSo  We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger .\nWe already know that . Just a normal battery .\nYeah . We have batteries .\nOkay . The chip-on-print is a normal one .\nYeah .\nRegular .\nOkay , the case is just a plastic one .\nYeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .\nYeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular .\nYou have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second .\nOkay .\nI think I'll just check it .\nAnd we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .\nYes .\nThat's pretty much it .\nYeah .\nAnd a flashy light .\nUser interface concept .\nSo uh I'm not sure . But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . But\nI dunno either .\nMm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ?\nUh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .\nYeah . That's for the next one .\nSo we should did it here ?\nThat's for th\nSo we're staying here ?\nUh that  I think that's the next next meeting .\nOr should we do it in the next meeting ? Okay .\nBut you definitely get a specific instruction .\nOkay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?\nYeah .\nBut th think about something that's more rounded . Just  And more  It has to be\nYeah , uh I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones .\nUh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom .\nJust a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those .\nMaybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . O um if you draw it like this , you get a  What the fuck is it ?  Okay . Mm  Doesn't work .  You see what I mean ?\nWhat ?\nIf I draw here   It draws about four centimetres lower than\nOh . Okay .\nNah okay . Just  . Maybe you can make it like this . And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um  It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one .\nLike a very big scroll-wheel .\nYeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .\nOkay .\nMaybe , I dunno .\nHmm .\nOkay , so we  have this at the moment .\nI think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .\nYeah , you\nOkay , so\nYeah .\nwe'd have this . Is that okay ?\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nthat's a little problem , of course , as well .\nI think it's probably better .\nAnd\nYeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger .\nYeah , maybe you just have to make it uh  That's not scrollable too easy .\nLike this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? Still on the bottom\nI think in middle .\nor\nUh wh what is the middle part ?\nThat's the numbers .\nNumbers , okay .\nUh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .\nYeah , I agree as well .\nIt doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .\nUse the dz\nBecause you already have the volume here , so  You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other .  back and forth .\nYeah , that's right .\nSo you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well .\nOr you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .\nBut that's not  want to zap very quick , so\nYeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority .\nYeah , okay .\nYeah ? Is this a opportunity ,\nAnd then you use those uh\nor you don't want a different\nYeah , of course uh .\nUh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so\nWhy ?\nBecause then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up\nBut still the next  It's still the next one . Doesn't make\nYeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is   If you put them\nYeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference .\nYeah . I I think it's  It's it's obvious , I think .\nBut uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .\nYeah , that's not not  It's not al uh always the same .\nBut it's exactly th\nIn uh  On most on most remote controls .\nEvery remote control's uh different .\nYeah , I think\nSo so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .\nI dunno . I  You already have the volume on the side ,\nNo , uh I think\nso you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake .\nYeah .\nSo it's uh\nI think it's s so simple\nI dunno .\nyou just\nSo but that's for that's for you ,\nOkay .\n'cause it's\nYeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it .\nOkay , so hmm . What did  What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno .\nThink we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?\nYeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control .\nYeah .\n'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .\nAnd the LED .\nNo , you have uh  It is\nYeah , but i i it should be round in in shape .\nUh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic .\nSo\nYou have to look at that image of the iPod .\nYes . Okay .\nMore that uh kind of style .\nAnd a bit uh\nNot not the old grey black\nUh  Yeah .\nSome some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have\nWhere you can put a ve Uh we have  If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .\nYeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right .\nUh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ?\nYeah , five . Let's give five .\nOr more or\nMaybe you can buy separate ones and uh\nAnd um uh  uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic .\nYeah . Um\nOr you can choose one uh if you buy the project .\nI think  Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh .\nNo , tha that will be\nSo y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ?\nYes .\nSo you could put it like that ,\nYeah , so top down .\nokay .\nHmm ?\nYeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station .\nDo we have to design that w as well ?\nYeah .\nUh I'm not sure .\nThe docking station ?\nYeah , I think so .\nHmm .\nBut th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least .\nYeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet .\nYeah , just a recharger .\nYeah , just where you're around something . Li Yeah , we had one example .\nBut we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .\nMm . Mm .\nYeah ,\nWhich w\nbut that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then .\nHere you see one that's very round .\nOh yeah , okay .\nSo I think that can be all kind of shapes .\nBut maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . That's all .\nOf the remote control ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah\nJust round it up  .\nYeah .\nYeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod  . But\nNo . Yeah . Yeah .\nMore rounded . Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's  This is also rounded .\nNo , just just the corners .\nI think i\nYeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm\nOkay .\nYeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh  As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes .\nShapes .\nYeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new .\nNot in depth . Yeah , but   Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new .\nI've uh  I had a lot of picture of old ones . And all curves have already been done .\nIt's a bit annoying , isn't it ?\nYeah . What do we do wrong ? Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square .\nYeah okay , yeah well\nOkay .\nYeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . I would do it\nYeah . I know we can do a lot more , but\nYeah , it\nLike in this kind of shape or\nUh it's very annoying . Okay .\nI dunno . I dunno if it's handy .\nI think it will only look more like the old remote controls .\nUh\nThis ?\nYeah .\nThe olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing .\nYeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures  Oh I can show you here  what the old ones look like .\nMm .\nCurves , curves .\nYeah .\nYou've more  there as well .\nYeah , okay .\nIt wasn't very small one .  very simple .\nYeah .\nThat is for elderly .\nSo we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have .\nYeah , I don't know .\nYeah .\nI think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look .\nYeah .\nSo uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new .\nMm-hmm .\nNo rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .\nYeah .\nAnd you have the scroll button inside .  Okay .\nYes . Just a simple scrollb\nYeah .\nBut why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of  Skip that one as well .\nDoesn't have to be .\nOkay . Yeah , it's cool .\nYeah , though that's a trend . If we want to make it . But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are .  So\nUh the t the trend is\nRubber spongy .\nspongy and fruity .\nYeah . No . Spongy\nBut yeah .\nSpongeball kinda .\nand\nIt's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh\nOkay , so we have s still one minute left . So just\nUh\nI think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .\nMm .\nOkay . Yeah ,\nIt  The th th\nI d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff .\nNo .\nYeah .\nBut I I think it's still for older people . You j still have older people . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal\nYeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public .\nThere is one  There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . It must have uh uh uh a very different\nYeah ,  idea . But  you're  If you look at the way remote controls are now\nBut i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy .\nAnd if you make it look like the iPod\nYeah , they're all the same .\nYeah okay . So that's already a very big change\nUh maybe maybe make the the mm the  wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction .\ncompared to\nHmm .\nYe yeah . Well uh\nYeah , we could do that .\nCould .\nUh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow .\nYeah .\nNo , I think  Oh .\nIt's right .\nThink the scroll wheel  won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big .\nYeah .\nSo it will just be a small small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much .\nYeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has  if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly . So maybe you have to ask her .\nYeah okay . Well ,\nNo .\nmaybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint .\nOkay . Yeah . That's probably\nI'll be able to do a better job .\nIf you set the pen yeah , he will draw here . Doesn't work .\nOkay , so just finish it . So we make it a bit like m that one probably . Yeah . Is that okay ?\nYeah , I'll see it .\nBu Yeah , I agree more like iPod  .\nYeah .\nOkay , only the colour and the flashy light and the\nYes .\nWe just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .\nJust a  Speech . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think\nOr keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a\nS\nWell uh\nadvanced chip .\nthen it w\nUh yeah , I don't know . Yeah , I think so .\nUh\nAnd we we have to build in a microphone and\nWell that's very easy . We already have uh the beeping of the  home station ,\nYeah , and I do I don't know anything about that .\nso\nI d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition ,\nNo .\nUh strange that I received  the information about that .\nso\nOh that's hard . But\nSo\nUh the ma the main points I I I uh just said . We have to be original and uh technological innovative . Becau\nCan we just put it speech recognition in it as well ,\nYeah . But\nokay ?\nSo\nMa\nshall we  it open then ?\nYeah .\nSo we can put all the\nThe function of that in there . Yeah .\nOkay .\nAnd we need a  Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .\nFine . Yeah , we probably do .\nBut it doesn't say anything about it ,\nYeah .\ndoes it ?\nNo .\nOh yeah , I\nBut we don't have any f information about the cost .\nNo .\nWe started with information about the cost was now th\nI just I just received the\nYeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip .\nYeah .\nAnd how much is the chip ? The the the\nI don't know how much , but\nYeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .\nJust in inexpensive or\nThis is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .\nAnd how how does it work ? Is it\nDoesn't say . Just  You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . Because uh  So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning .\nIt doesn't has to say anything . Just  You have to just talk to\nNo .\nYeah uh th that's just  It's a\nDoes it say does it say something back ?\nOkay , we have to stop it now . So just\nNo . Yeah , it  Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it .\nOkay , that's a r That's that's a advanced\nBut i it's a separate chip .\nI dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .\nOkay .\nYeah , I don't know anything about this ,\nUm\nYeah , we just decide not to put it in ,\nbut  Nah .\nbecause it's too difficult .\nI dunno .\nWell it it would be would be a good feature feature .\nYeah .\nOkay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature .\nOkay .\nWe have to stop now .\nNo no worries about the cost , etcetera .\nOkay , just\nAnd there's a chip in it that will\nWe have to stop it now .\nOkay .\nFine .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "batteries, electronic, battery, recharger, transistors", "dialogue_id": 93}, {"text": "Okay .\nOkay everyone's ready .\nHello .\nSo we are here for uh for uh functional design .\nOkay ?

So  most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd  but other people want th also remotes for  controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff\nMm-hmm .\nand other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . So\nMm-hmm .\nthere is one  that is one thing . The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have\nOkay .\nuh at the same time as  and general voice commands if you want yeah .  So I think it should be a package in that case .\nMm-hmm .\nUh so the user interface will consist of two parts .  One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part .  Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\na set of buttons for  linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .\nOkay .\nYeah ?\nWhat do you mean by linear access then ?\nLike a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .\nAh .\nOkay so special navigation , linear access , random access\nUm .\nand there's a fourth one no ?\nMm ?\nSo the better now for special navigation ?\nYeah . For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ?\nOkay . Then linear access\nUh .\nthen random access .\nMm . Yeah and also parameter changing .\nAh yeah parameter okay .\nSo if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um\nOkay .\nor maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and  basically this is most of the  almost everybody has this stuff .\nOkay . Okay and and voice command did you uh\nVoice command w we could specify anything . We could assign any button  a command to any button , if we have enough processing power ,\nOkay . Okay .\nI guess so .  Yeah .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nSo that's uh that close your investigations ?\nYeah .\nOkay .\nUh yeah I think so .\nOkay .\nNot so far .\nMaybe we can have a look at the user requirements with", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remotes, remote, commands, buttons, finder", "dialogue_id": 94}, {"text": "Yeah .

Uh this is this email .\nI'm designing the user interface .\nOkay . You can uh .\nOkay . So maybe I can switch slides when you  whenever you ask ,\nYeah .\nthat will be more convenient . So okay , functional requirements .\nOkay so you can  you can go . Okay so  in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects\nMm .\nand the subjects also filled a questionnaire\nYeah .\nokay ? And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more  more nice , more kind . Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy .  Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look\noh  to  it's not good .  So okay .\nWe can just keep doing that ?\nSo it's not in theory  but I I can I can say yeah .\nYeah .\nFifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . So mm  we have to have a remote control uh very um  out for that .  Uh the buttons have  are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks .\nOkay .\nUm and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh  ten per cents of but of the buttons in the  in the remote control .\nOkay .\nSo all the buttons we we have to put are  have to to have um a use a real use\nOkay .\nand not only or\nOkay , so fewer buttons maybe would be good ?\nYeah . F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons  .\nOkay .\nBut what kind of remote controls did you look at ?\nSorry ?\nWhat kind of task was it ? It was a T_V_ ?\nYeah . Uh  most for most is T_V_ .\nYeah . Yeah but in fact we  it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management\nHuh .\nbo I will present them in the following .\nUh-huh . Ah ! Good .\n'Kay you can go so .\nOkay .\nSo there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to  to\nYeah . To find it .\nto find it .\nYeah .\nUm and um lot of the time they  it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .\nYeah .\nSo they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nAnd uh remote controls are bad for\nWhat is her other side ?\nR_S_I_  um\nOther side yeah , yo wa your wrist\nI dunno .\nIt i can become painful you can have tendonditis .\nOh yeah ?\nYeah .\nI did not knew that .\nIf you also  up on a computer in a strange position .\nOkay so you  we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah .\nErgonomic . But uh  .\nYeah .\nHave to say ha ha .\nIt's your job\nOh .\nUh .\nUh sorry  got a message from Microsoft .\nOkay um before that I I have some some  some thing  uh to say before um\nYeah . Yeah yeah .\nWe know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel .\nYeah .\nUm and um to to change uh volume selection of the\nOkay .\nand uh and not uh a lot for setting  for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nSo it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and\nYeah . This function should be very uh accessible .\nVery accessible yes .\nYeah , okay . This is the main function okay .\nThat's right .  So then we asked some questions to them\nYeah .\nand um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control\nYeah .\nand if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control\nYeah .\nand you can go  we have here the results of\nThe first question .\nof the questions . So you know that um\nfor the younger it's very important\nTo have L_C_D_ and voice .\nto have the s yes and speech recognition . And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh .\nOkay .\nSo maybe we we can have a speech recognition in .\nYeah maybe this this is important .\nYeah .\nMoreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can\nMm .\nwe have to take care of that point of view I think or so .\nMm .\nYeah .\nOkay and if there is th the conclusion now . So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing .\nOkay .\nUh not to many mud buttons like we we said before ,\nYeah .\ne easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nAn I s no , yeah .\nOkay these are the user requi\nI dunno if you see something else important or\nI'm just thinking of some thing .\nYeah .\nMm .\nUm  We want to have a  no , I don't know if this is a good idea . We want to have a a general remote control for everything .\nNo no no . We  w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control . From the management board I receive an email .\nMm .\nOkay . Yeah .\nCos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control .\nYeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah .\nMm  I  it's not true I think . The the second claim that you put .\nNo no .\nThat it would be too long to develop .\nYeah .\nI think that should be the same .\nOh yeah . Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . So maybe it's a good decision . I dunno . What's your opinion ?\nI have uh I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it .\nI don't think\nUh yeah .\nFinish tonight .\nYeah . Okay .

So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control .\nMaybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do\nIf fact\nI don't know .\nYeah but\nMm .\nDo I have  oh yeah .\nNow I have enough cables .\nLike a  you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff .\nOkay so I'm just going to describe  in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . We just have\nsorry , I'm going\nOkay .\nAre you okay ?\nLike that . I'm just going to describe . Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . After that we just have um user interface . Let's say that um something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . Push button or a L_C_D_ . After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared  um which is a an infrared um component . And so what we  for for myself this  for for us this is quite easy .\nU_C_ is the central unit ?\nYeah .\nOkay yeah .\nY it's a  it's  this just a chip which does all the um numerical\nComputation .\nnumerical computation according to your display .\nOkay .\nAnd so for us uh this is quite easy . We just need to take  to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the  not the  to the television .\nOkay .\nSo for us this is quite easy .\nOkay so this is quite easy . There is not that much constraints .\nYeah . Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple\nThis will  think this will take more time to develop also .\nYeah of course of course .\nYeah .\nAnd um but for a standard one this is really easy . It's a question of one month and so on s\nSoon .\nTo have a  you s you speak about with voi voice control ?\nNo no no no ,\nStandard button one .\nI say  yeah  standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that .\nYeah . So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nDefinitely .\nYeah .\nSo do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?\nTen years .\nI would say  .\nI would say uh about eight months to have the first results .\nOkay so i it's a bit long yeah .\nYeah . I can  Um .\nOne month for the standard one with button .\nYeah .\nEven if we have a L_C_D_ display ?\nYeah even . I mean that this is really standard devices now . Um eight . For uh speech recognition .\nOkay yeah . Okay so we can take this into account . So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ?\nBut we don't have time to market .\nYeah it will .\nAnd also  how much uh I think\nI think we should contact management .\nduring the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't  we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit\nEuros . Yeah , yeah .\nso how many units should we sell to have a\nWell . Uh\nWell each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros .\nYeah but how many  yeah .\nHow muc how much do you get  how much do you  if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units .\nEh chips . We're gonna need chips right .\nYeah .\nYeah . How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?\nUsually this is less tha at two dollars per chip .\nOkay .\nBecause we are\nSo you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition .\nYeah ,\nYeah ? Okay .\nwe can\nSo .\nIt seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting .\nNo it doesn't .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .

Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have .\nMm .\nUm I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta ?\nYeah I I will continue .\nIs it\nWell ask your question if you want .\nUm you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent\nMm ?\nof the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control .\nYeah .\nDo they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ?

Mm-hmm .\nOkay . It's not intuitive first .\nAnd\nBut  Yeah .\nBut yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? You say that I want , I have six button\nMh-hmm . A a lot of people are uh  if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them\nYeah .\nYeah . But , but also it seems that\nYeah .\nbut it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh\nYeah .\nYeah .\nso it's really something for the expert user . So\nOkay .\nI mean there are markets and markets . I think the young people are th uh are uh\nChristine here said uh you have a\nYeah .\nYeah .\nuh it is yeah .  So for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . I guess . I don't know if there is study about that .\nYeah . Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple  than creating a simple product .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm .\nYeah .\nMm .\nAnd there are  another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else .\nYeah .\nAll right ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nOtherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has  somebody has to learn to use it first .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nBut also we we see that that most people find it  find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nSo we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons\nYeah .\nand maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . Losed lose it etcetera .\nMm-hmm .\nThese  these are  these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nSo but le let us see first the new requirement . So we don't have to  so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that\nBut teletext is just one button .\nYeah but then you have to  you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff .\nYou you just write the  write the numbers .\nYeah . So well\nSo will you add with the channel keys , right ?\nYeah . So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users ,\nSo .\nthey prefer to s\nI am . I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button .\nYeah . I dunno .\nSo .\nIf i one button is still one more button . If  if  if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors .\nMm-hmm .\nWell anyway I have this point . We can discuss . Also um  so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the  on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . So this is the the key point .\nSo before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the  o th of the control  of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .\nCapital .\nMm .\nSo do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used\nMm .\nonly ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point , no ?\nMm-hmm .\nWell if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple .\nMm .", "topic_id": 4, "keywords": "buttons, controls, remote, control, button", "dialogue_id": 94}, {"text": "Yeah okay . So yeah the key point here is simple . Maybe .  So few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that ?\nWell if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see\nYeah .\nreally .\nMaybe switch T_V_ on and off\nUh\nno you want to keep television on so that the advertising can  revenue can come back to us .\nYeah . Yeah .\nOr something .\nVolume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button .\nMm .\nAnd that's all ?\nUh I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of  a lot of zapping .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nI know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now ,\nIt's a memory , yeah .\nyou have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back .\nOkay . Yeah this is cool . Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button . So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nAnd uh and of course the channel changing buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . I I talk about that , yeah ?\nHow should they how should we implement that ? Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental .\nYeah . Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them .\nMm-hmm .\nLet's say that we can do something like that . This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five .\nWe go faster ?\nTo go fa to go faster .\nMm .\nMm . It's an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . So if you you have your ten buttons for the  for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have  instead of having just one memory\nYeah .\nyou have if you press them for a long time  No . Doesn't work  does it .\nMaybe we should have also a digit button\nMaybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands .\nYeah .\nChange channel to eight .\nMaybe we have also to have digits or only incremental .\nNo .\nI dunno bec because if you have the\nWell if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot  you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental .\nUh . Yeah . Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo I think we need also digits .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nMaybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits .\nYeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time\nYeah .\nand\nOr we can do something like that .\nYeah .\nWe can design the remote control to have access . You know some remote control have uh protection\nMm-hmm .\nand so you you y\nYeah .\nHey I just thought this thing\nYou\nthere is a  I mean you know there is are some  with a wheel like this . Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel .\nYeah .\nYeah , a kind of joystick .\nYeah .\nYeah . Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nSo have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nand uh yeah I think this is the basi\nOn the lower side I think it  you have to turn it .\nAnd do we  do we have a\nNo ? If we do that .\nOr a  or a ball , yeah , not a a wheel but a ball , and you say uh to\nNo , a wheel is better .\nYeah .\nI would say the wheel is better .\nBecause of that\nWhat is the expert of uh\nYeah .\nThe channels change one by one .\nYeah .\nSo you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit .\nYeah , the\nOkay .\nyeah .\nYeah . That's a good idea .\nYeah .\nWell also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control .\n'S quite  it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the  on the wheel .\nOkay .\nYeah . Even if i L_E_D_ uh or a if if it's the L_C_D_ feature uh\nA blue  a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that um .\nYeah ,\nwhatever , yeah .\nand do we put an L_C_D_ display ?\nYeah .\nBecause it was important for young customers if you remember .\nI think it's only put on if cou have multi function . If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ .\nYeah .\nJust increase the cost .\nOkay .\nThe user does not have an advantage really .\nSo no L_C_D_ ?\nMm-hmm .\nHmm .\nAnd so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process\nWell if it's going to delay yeah\nOkay .\nbut uh  it will be cool . It would . Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . Mm .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . That would be cool .

Matthew is uh late again .\nMm-hmm .\nProbably an important man . Um . So well it is important for him to be here uh .\nYeah .\nHe he he\nSo what can you   ?\nYou did work together didn't you ?\nYeah we will  yeah , so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting ,\nYes .\nbut still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . I think we can put on the  here .\nYes . Yes .\nUh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items .\nMm . Um yes\nUm , can we have a phone ,\nbut w we\ncan someone\nYes , maybe we should phone him . Um well  Um ,\nit's really w well designed  .\nMm . Mm , object tracking .\nwhen he is not here we will just we just have to continue . Um so just for record I I will take uh notes again .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nAnd um well  first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .\n'Kay .\nwhen you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . There is no  uh no negotiation uh  possible in this matter . So we have to consider that .  Good .\nYep .\nUm so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation .\nWell we can't  no  we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design .\nOkay Matthew . Nice uh you are here .\nGreat .\nGreat . Great . Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs .\nYep . So I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros ,\nMm-hmm .\nand uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board .\nMm 'kay .\nAnd you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf  when they see this stuff .\nOr browse .\nAnd also it's not too far from um a mobile .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nSo people are used to that kind of shape ,\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nright . Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take\nNow we are supposed to give some oper offers right now .\nyeah . So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led\nMm-hmm .\nEye .\nI  yeah .\nyeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ ,\nL_E_D_ .\nthe on-off button , in red .\nMm-hmm .\nHere would be the volume . On the on the left ,\nOh yeah .\nUh-huh .\nokay , so\nMm-hmm , hmm .\nYes .\neasy to turn on t and off . And um so this is a very cheap version so there are  maybe you can carry on uh Matthew .\nAlso  so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually\nMm-hmm .\nso you can go up and down the channels ,\nYeah .\nuh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back .\nHow can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ?\nOh  no no no , this is a single  this this is a model with just the T_V_ one .\nOkay yeah . Yeah yeah .\nAh , okay .\nNo no just sorry , this is a standard T_V_ one , we are not talking about that . So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits .\nMm-hmm .\nThe extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually .\nYeah .\nOkay so\nMm-hmm .\nit's it's t a very basic remote then , it's only\nIt's a very basic minimal thing\nMm .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nwhich you can  which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it   that it   i\nand would cost us to build it about eight Euros .\nMm .\nMm .\nSeven , eight , ei eight Euros .\nExce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nSo this one model\nCan I see ?\nand uh  yeah . Sure .\nThanks . Okay I like the volume control , that's good .\nTh  this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that ,\nyou know like\nuh i i i it is a very futuristic , it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come .\nUh-huh .\nYeah .\nSo it doesn't actually have buttons .\nSo that uh   then what we look t\nDid you wanna see ?\nyeah .\nMm-hmm . Yeah no you can carry on ,\nThis is a model ,\nI just look how it feels all .\nyeah .\nYes it really feels like like like a mobile phone .\nMm .\nYeah .\nYep .\nJust I'm\nYeah actually , yeah .\nI really want to talk to it .\nIt won't talk back .\nBut  .\nSo but but continue with your uh\nUh so well\nmm-hmm .\nthen the this is the  a more a little uh smooth\nand it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here .\nRight .\nMm .\nAnd so they have more space actually\nMm-hmm .\nand uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh  uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have ,\nMm-hmm .\nand then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo\nPlay , pause .\nyeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display , here\nMm-hmm .\nand uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it\nFrom D_V_D_ player to television or something .\nExactly yeah . To audio and to video on demand .\nYeah . I really can change it ,\nYes .\nso\nMm .\nInstead of having many switches , y\nMm-hmm .\nYes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah .\nThe L_C_D_ can display what is that on that ,\nYes .\nMm-hmm .\nand uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here ,\nThis is the orange button , the  microphone .\nor in the button th here ,\nMm-hmm .\nso which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display .\nAn yeah .\nAnd here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhich tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier\nMm-hmm  .\nYeah .\nokay . And uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this ,\nYeah .\nwhen you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover\nMm . Yeah\nCrazy dis designer ,\nyou know .\nokay .\nDesign enter  .\nbut but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ?\nYeah .\nYeah yeah yeah yeah .\nYeah . It's basically to do that .\nBut but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature\nYeah .\nwhich shouldn't be shouldn't be\nActually when you are watching the T_V_ ,  when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here ,\nOh actually  well .\nThat th that's true .\nyou know , uh you want to uh  and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection\nMm .\nbecause when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Yes , more robust .\nit's more robust that way . Uh yeah .\nMm .\nYes okay .\nAnd you have very good chances\nIt's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nSo the the cost is actually a bit more , it's uh  it's it's sixteen Francs .\nIt  Sixteen Euros .\nOkay .\nSixteen Euros sorry .\nSo it's well outside the budget then .\nThen it's out of budget .\nBut w\nBut the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item\nYeah .\nso\nThree Euros .\nthree Euros sorry . And um\nThat's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ?\nNo no no , part of that , yeah .\nPart of that  .\nSo that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition .\nYeah , yeah .\nMm 'kay . Hmm .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWell uh if you  we can have  if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know\nMm-hmm .\nWell I think th th yeah we should  stick with uh a number of keys\nMm .\nbecause if we add too much then\nYeah\nMm-hmm  .\nit's too\nit it should not be cluttering up everything .\nWhat's this one on the side ?\nAh that's for the  it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery\nLocati . Location .\nAh okay .\nand as well as it's like a blinking one\nMm-hmm . Mm 'kay .\nyou know\nYeah .\nyou can keep it aside .\nI like the shape of them , I do like the the size and the the shape .\nWell well  Mm .\nYeah .\nBe before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "designs, design, meeting, slides, presentation", "dialogue_id": 95}, {"text": "Mm-hmm . Okay . And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two .\nYes . Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at .\nOkay .  Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view .\nMm-hmm .\nWe just wanna make sure that we've taken into account\nWell\nYep .\njust do it quickly if if we al already  .\nSo it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product .\nMm-hmm .\nUm we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so   These are the things we identified as being important . Um  the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components\nMm-hmm .\num appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ?\nUm , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now ,\nOkay . So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . Not sure how this is gonna come out . So the first one was really  very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? 'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a\nMm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd then  I mean w w w you must just see it   we can still spend this four and a half Euro\nMm-hmm . Yep .\nand to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nso we just have to offer as much as as  well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro .\nFunctionality .\nOkay so look and feel , innovation\nAnd now it  easy to use .\nEasy to use .\nMm .\ntarget .\nMm-hmm . And trends . Oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? Is that part of both of them or ?\nUm well w w we can still discuss that .\nOkay .\nSo um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas\nMm-hmm .\nI mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut um I've received uh a framework which we can do this . I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ?\nMm-hmm .\nNo .\nNo .\nNo .\nNo okay , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components ,\nso we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh .\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nSo maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one .\nOkay . Yep . So it's the pink .\nTh th this is the first design .\nAnd the other one's green . Okay , so\nYes .\nlook and feel ? Where um one is  I've broken the pen again . S\nUh there is another pen .\nyeah . Get that one . Um w  one's bad and seven's the best . Sorry , one's true and seven's false . One's the best .\nOkay .\nSo on a scale of one to seven ?\n'Kay . Okay . So . Look and feel . Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think  .\nIn i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm , yeah . Mm-hmm .\nso I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel .\nMm-hmm .\nBut that's just half , we should also consider look ,\nMm-hmm .\nand then i it looks quite conventional .\nMm .\nDon't you agree ?\nMm yeah .\nOn the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at ,\nSo maybe two . Hmm . Hmm . Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five\nso\nI  It's my opinion , but I don't know what what\nWell I will give it maybe  we have anyways  the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nyou know . It  though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case\nYeah . Four maybe .\nyou know .\nFour ? Okay .\nFour , four .\nFour yeah\nNow we th th\nthat\nMm-hmm .\nthen we settle on four .\nYeah . I will gi yeah .\n'Kay . Can you maybe fix the other\nUh . Yeah .\nMm .\nIf you press like this not like this  then you\nNo that's the\nNo .\nink's dried .\nC can you get the batteries ? No no the battery has fallen down ,\nBattery's low , isn't it the ink ?\nthat's i\nThe b that's the that that one ?\nYeah .\nbattery there .\nBut\nNo no it's not that , it's how to close a battery .\nOkay .\nOkay ? Now it should be  .\nMm . No I think it's lost a battery .\nMm , try it , just try it .\nNo it's  It would still write\nOh it will not\nbut it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors .\nri mm , mm .\nIs there another battery there ? Oh yeah .\nYou got a second ?\nTry a\nWell we won't be able to tell .\nYes , it it has a  mm .\nPerfect .\nIs that working ?\nDid it come out ? Good . Okay .\nGood . Good .\nBecause we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just a normal whiteboard marker\nYeah , yeah .\nbut it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard .\nYep .\nOkay . So then then\nAnd the other one ?\nWow .\nI think it's slightly better , um ,\nAh . Mm .\nit's hard to tell from just the plasticine ,\nI  I  I\nbut\nWhen we want to include  I I I'm doubting about this this component .\nMm .\nIt it it it breaks in your\n'Kay\nMm .\nmaybe\nNo actually this is this is not going to protrude actually ,\nOkay .\nit it's n i it is jus\nIt's not a button it's a led , it's a\nIt's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve\nAc actually yeah it should be embedded .\nMm , yes I see , mm okay .\nMm-hmm . Yeah .\nIt's  will be embedded there\nYeah . Oh\nso it won't be really you know protruding or something .\nyou can push push it again , you can push it .\nYeah . The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ?\nYeah .\n'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand ,\nYeah .  Yeah .\nmaybe it won't work so well .\nNo you  it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that\nOkay .\nWell r r\nI'd say two or three for that one , personally .\nMm .\nProbably more towards three than two .\nI think the look is better\nbut the feel is is is worse . So so  I would also say this is four .\nOkay .\nBut w w do you  what do you think ?\nUh it's fine I think . My  just that um the feel is that um you  right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one .\nYeah .\nMm . Mm . Yes .\nThis is how embedded one will\nYes , it basically is the same shape .\nYeah . It's a bas basically the same thing actually .\nMm-hmm . Mm .\nYou will be  Except that in this c\nAnd the L_C_D_ makes it better . Yeah .\nYeah\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nAnd  you might have a slight thing for to forward and\nMm , okay . Yeah\nSo I will say two .\nit's d it's definitely more fancier than that one .\nYes , okay  .\nYeah , yeah .\nI would say two , three .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nSo , consensus ? Two or three ?\nTwo ?\nTwo ?\nMm . Two's good\nYep .\nyes .\nlooking like\nUm , 'kay . Innovation . The first one , not really muc\nBasically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market ,\nMm . Yeah .\nright ?\nDo we\nNo but except for the design of the surf  .\nYeah . The surf uh design  .\nMm .\nMm .\nWhat  What features are we actually including ?\nYou should be rea\nAre we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ?\nUh no\nThere's nothing like that ?\nI think it's more of the feel .\nBut th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , it's just a straight-out remote control .\nYeah , yeah .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nThe only innova innovation is the shape .\nYeah  .\nSay about that .\nOkay .\nS so that\nSo there's no  this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation .\nYeah . You're right  .\nYeah .\nSo I'd be up for seven for innovation .\nYeah . And the  And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation .\nYep .\nMm .\nAnd um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part .\nYeah , it gives it\nYes . A and the L_C_D_ screen is\nYeah .\nThat's that's that's well it's quite innovative .\nAnd all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this .\nMm .\nUh could put it at one or two I would say . Personally .\nOkay .\nYeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm .\nYep .\nSo what is it , what are the innovations with this ? Got the L_C_D_ screen .\nUh  Yeah automatic speech recognition .\nIs that in this one though ? Is this  'cause this is the  Th th there were different options we discussed then ,\nNo , we ha\nwe discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget .\nWe just diske discuss it as you designed it\nOkay .\nand then we will will try to get it in the budget .\nYeah .\nSo the cost for these were\nSo\nwhat was the cost for the first one ? Eight Euros ?\nEight .\nEight . Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah .\nYeah , eight Euros yeah .\nAnd this one was sixteen Euros .\nYes .\nSixteen .\nSixteen Euros .\nOkay . So . Innovation for this one is two ? One ?\nIt's a two , I would say two  .\nTwo ?\nTwo .\nW W un to be one what would do we nee actually , yeah , I don't see\nWhy it is one .\nokay , one would would be without buttons ,  .\nA man  w w\nMm . Well\nYeah .\nthe speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it ,\nYes .\nBu\nso\nYeah . So maybe we can put one .\nThis this is it w with the speech recognition ?\nIt's using speech recognition , yeah .\nWell .\nOkay yeah .\nGi given that  that it works ,\nGive it a one ?\nYeah , one , yeah .\nYep .\nthen it's I think one .\nOkay .\nEase of use ?\nUh\nSo the first one is really standard ,\nMm .\nso everybody i including our grandmothers can use it ,\nHe is used to it act\nYeah .\nMm .\nright ?\nThey are used to it actually .\nYep . So that's maybe a a two for ease of use .\nYeah .\nHere there may\nUm , the other one is quite easy , tho though .\nUh , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi\nOkay . So maybe a three or a four .\nHmm .\nUh yeah , actually in fact I think it will be\nOne me um we hope\nYeah\nmaybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons .\nMm .\nYeah but  y\nAnd there is a  like I would say three . Or maybe four  .\nOkay . Consensus ? Three or four ?\nWell we have reduced the keys actually you see .\nThree , I would . Three .\nThree ? Okay .\nYeah , yeah\nThree is fine with me .\nbecause it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so ,\nYeah it's a\nNo .\nactually the user has to put some effort to do  use that actually ,\nMm-hmm .\nit's not so easy , like this one the normal .\nYeah . Yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy .\nIs quite easy yeah .\nSo so I think th three is good . Yeah .\nInitially there there is a lot of effort , yeah .\nOkay .\nGood .\nSo three's\nWhat's the next ?\nuh how well it goes to the target demographic . So we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ?\nSo\nMm .\nTwe twenty to forty , yes that's\nThat's\nThis one would be uh for grandmothers  .\nMm .\nOh no , this would I\nNo .\nI would I would give this model to the old people actually .\nYeah , grandmothers , yeah .\nYeah .\nSo sh completely changed our demographic there ,\nMm-hmm .\nAnd\nit's not part of the the funky young thing .\nWell exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think ,\nYeah that's true . Yeah .\nYeah . If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being  applying to the the demographic\nbut\nYeah .\nyeah . That's  it's still  Ye\nMm w w w we  after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic\nMm . 'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it ,\nMm .\nthat's right .\nBut as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nOh yeah ,  .\nAnd\nDo you agree ?\nI\nYeah because it's so important  it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its  it targets , the right range of people ,\nWell I think\nMm .\nright ?\nYeah . Uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually .\nYeah .\nBut it's going to be cheap whatever though ,\nBut w\nSo\nit was set with i we've got a set price .\nAnd people can still decide to use the cheaper one\nYeah .\ninstead of a\nBut for us it's  yeah  we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros .\nMm , yeah , indeed .\nYeah . There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one .\nYeah .\nJu just think , twenty five Euros , I mean it's not going to be cheaper .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nOkay . So in that case well it's fine then .\nOkay . Um\nMm . Mm . Okay .\nWe can  yeah .\nand the demokraphi demographic of the second one ?\nAnd the demographics of\nIt's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen\nYeah tha tha tha tha tha that's\nand\nI think it's better ,\nMm .\nbecause of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the\nYeah .\non the  and on the\nYeah . And if you want to target  yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen .\nMm-hmm .\nMm . So , the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts ,\nYeah .\nyes .\nI think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good .\nBecause it  Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes  ,\nYeah .\nMm . Okay .\nso . Wh what  what\nI'd probably go with three again for that one .\nYeah I think it's uh  it has more market actually .\nOr even  Even one and two . Or two .\nMm-hmm .\nNo s say t two .\nY yeah , you know\nOkay . So , two , yeah ?\ntwo .\nTwo ?\nYeah . Two yeah .\nYeah two yeah . Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add  lot of sophistication on that .\nMm-hmm .\nBecause then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include\nYeah . Yep . And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well ,\nfor the people to\nand that makes it more appealing , it's more of a a new fun toy .\nWe have to practically test it .\nMm-hmm .\nThe field test will tell you how good .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay , the final point , trends .\nAnd following the trends .\nThe trends .\nSo the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel .\nMm . Mm .\nSo as it is , not really doing either of them .\nI think\nSpongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water .\nWell ,\nthe spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well ,\nMm-hmm .\nI know some  have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and  not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons\nUh okay .\nit's got just a one bit on it\nMm .\nYeah I know .\nand so you can  that feels kinda spongy .\nBut this one includes this feature , right ? Spongy buttons .\nSo it's sort of , yeah .\nYeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually .\nMm . Okay .\nSo  Uh\nMm .\nthe maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie .\nBut that's if you're using the covers .\nAnd the then we can al\nOr is it just one\nYeah .\nyes . We can  we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? I mean\nWell they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated .\nBut why do you want to cover that actually ? In that uh w in the mod\nWell just with the with the flexible plastic uh\nSo you got the option of having different colours or different textures .\nYeah . This is possible .\nI th I th I think\nUh uh y are you sure ? Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah .\nO o or just two things which can be put on each other .\nMm .\nYeah exactly like Nokia phones  .\nMm .\nYes , exactly like it .\nYep .\nUh , so Maybe we can  but we have to decide it , we can put the the  the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers\nMm-hmm .\nand s now try to invest in the in in the features .\nI think the  if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion\nMm .\neven next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion .\nMm mm mm mm mm .\nYeah . 'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black ,\nMm .\nand uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here .\nMm . Mm .\nSo maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things .\nMm . Yep .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nYep . Mm .\nMm . Mm .\nAnd then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers .\nYes . So so so that that would make the trends equal ,\nYeah .\nso we we we really have  don't have ,\nMm . There's n yeah . 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them .\nI mean\nAlthough it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one .\nYes , indeed .\nYeah , so a a point better for the for the number two  .\nOkay . So . Two and three , or one and two ?\nYes .\nYeah , it's one .\nSay , say one and two . One and two .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nSo le le let's see . So d\nOkay .\nthis one has spongy but buttons ?\nYeah , the blue one uh spongy .\nYeah , it says a\nMm , I see , yes okay . Good .\nOkay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five  mm nine by five , one point s eight ?\nJust add it .\nNine .\nYou know . Three , six , seven .\nOne point six , one point\nOne point eight yeah .\nThis one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two\nFour point  Uh four point two .\nyep .\nVery good .\nOkay . But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway .\nMm-hmm . We  we must try to get them closer .\nYeah , it's right , yeah that's right .\nYep .\nBoth in i i\nWow .\nor we just have to choose . And adapt .\nYep .\nBecause , when we choose for this one we have to  we have to make it more attractive\nMm-hmm .\nand w when we  to d for this one we have to make it more cheap .\nWell it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "evaluating, products, evaluation, marketing, product", "dialogue_id": 95}, {"text": "Yes , well\nThat'll basically take us down to the budget .\nBut I'm  now  did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ?\nSo I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros .\nMm .\nUh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew ,\nYeah . Yep .\nMm , tha\nso maybe we have to recap with this one .\nMaybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah .\nWell yes , well uh re reconsider it . So  let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet ,\nMm-hmm .\nuh what kind of energy source uh I I  we didn't speak about that . It's a  it's a normal battery , or\nYeah , it migh It  it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just  maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . What do you say , Mael ?\nFor this one it's a normal battery  .\nYes . Just so one battery . 'Kay . Electronics .  given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip .\nYeah .\nUh sample speaker , yeah .\nYeah , yes , or sample sensor , yes .\nSample , yeah , this one .\nYes , this one . Okay . Case ? Um ,\nSo\nCurved . Double curved yeah right .\nI see   I\nIt's uh\nMm .\nDouble curve .\nYeah , it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely .\nMm .\nSo which one are we talking to ?\nAre you talking about this or that ?\nWell\nEither of them .\nOh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm . They're both going to be not basic cases .\nbut , actually bu\nYeah .\nSo th th this would be double curves ?\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\n'Kay . Uh , plastic would be the material .\nYeah . The basic one , yep .\nIs it zero Franc ?\nA special colour ?\nUh special colour , now we leave it to the covers .\nUh\nSo now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display .\nPush . Mm , yes , but\nL_C_D_ is  . It's okay . Just say L_C_D_  .\nIs that price per unit , or for the whole thing ?\nYeah th now this is per per unit , this number of components .\nAh good .\nSo it would need twelve buttons .\nYeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ?\nNo but for this one it's twelve Euro .\nNo , for that one also .\nThere are twelve ?\nSo , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine ,\nYeah that's a scroll .\nt Yes . Twelve I believe . So this comes to eighteen .\nMm . And that's without any special button supplements .\nYeah , one scroll wheel you might need .\nSo\nSo we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . They're not just standard buttons .\nUh\nSo I think  but th do you agree th that thi\nWait a minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , right ? Because it's  there is no like  .\nBut I thought it would be curved on two\nYes I\nit's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought .\nYes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure .\nWell\nYes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes .\nit's  you know this curve like this so , it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are\nYou talking about concave curves ?\nUh-huh .\nyeah concave .\nBoth .\nSo I think we can put um\nYou think a single curved ?\nthe single curved in the sixteen . That makes uh seventeen . And what are just  The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? Yeah .\nMm .\nYes .   Uh\nWe have more , we've got those  the scroll wheel on the side\nSo\nand yeah\nI had a bad uh bad estimation .\nBad estimate ,\nThe sc\nW  d\nright ?\nwe have  we haven't talk about a  , but that's no a  is very exp inexpensive I believe\nMm .\nbut it is not in the list .\nWe've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there .\nW ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ?\nNo no no .\n'Kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast .\nYes , a kind of scroll wheel .\nSo this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros .\nMm . Mm-hmm .\nOkay ,\nso based on that , yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker\nThat is the sample sensor and sample speaker .\nSo  um\nBut still , yeah it\nWe just need that actually . We need one .\nWe're  We  We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ? Yes ?\nNo we cannot , yeah .\nSo so w when we w a\nSo\nS\nthis would this would be cutting the speech recognition .\nBut the um  Yeah but if you have the  near the L_C_D_ you can um  choose  select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip .\nTransti\nRight , Matthew ?\nOh I   i it\nOr regular chip ?\nI think it's going to be  y y\nI think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip .\nyeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah .\nSay  say it's regular , regular chip ,\nYeah . Okay . Okay .\nand we still on fifteen ,\nYeah .\nso\nSo . And what about the number of buttons buttons uh   my Matthew ?\nYes but that  maybe  Well we can just say\nUh\none .\nWhen you look at this w , this u uh item ,\nYeah .\nCa l we are just  when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty .\nBut\nSo is it possible ?\nBut that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material .\nMm-hmm .\nThat'll be  then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times .\nYou cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really  really low ,\nNo no ,\nWell\nhe he he I I\nno ?\nSo  the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh we don't want to to change that right ? We we really want a L_C_D_\nUh\nMm-hmm .\nother otherwise we w wouldn not get the market .\nOtherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this .\nIt's evident .\nMm .\nYeah .\nSo twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery ,\nAnd I dunno\nwe can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . And the chip .\nMm .\nSorry the chip's up there already .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nSo we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that .\nA\nSo wha what what each of us think about the  because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um  Do you think it's important ?\nOr we could even replace them by buttons actually .\nBecause sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? I dunno , I'm just asking .\nMm .\nMm\nA actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it ,\nYep .\nfor example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or  and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is  that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least .\nMm . Yeah . I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display .\nOkay so we can get rid of it\nYeah , it's true yeah .\nand then add a couple of buttons .\nBut uh , do we want that ? On the market point of view , yeah . What do you think uh , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ?\nMm . I\nFor the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there .  Mm .\nI  think we have to come to a decision now , just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display\nMm-hmm .\nso\nYou assume , you want a democratic voyt vote ,\nYes .\nright ? Okay .\nYes . Yes .  One man one vote .\nOkay .\nS so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ?\nI th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in .\nMm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nI think but\nWe need to be .\nBu y you're a power voter  uh veto anyway as Project Manager .\nMm-hmm , I know , but\nYeah .  .\nYeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that .\nwell we have to make a decision now , that's it .\nYes .\nYeah .\nSo uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . Is that acceptable ? Ca can I have  can the functions be implement in an\nYes .\nYou've  you you agree .\nW I I I just\nSo hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve .\nYeah .\nSo that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons  .\nBecause one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom .\nMm .\nMm . I think then we we're really losing ease of use .\nOkay ,  .\nThat will create another problem . For the people to use it . It's not going to be easy . Doing that .\nOkay .\nMm . So um\nOkay .\nI I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion .\nNo , it's okay , you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen\nJust\nand introduce two more buttons .\nOkay . So L_C_D_'s out , is speech rec out now ? We've\nThe speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , yeah .\nYep .\nUh where , L_C_\nYep .\nOkay w we now we can just uh\nSo are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . With these new costings .\nYeah .\nYes .\nSo  just look at  forget that one and look at that one now .\nYes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one\nYeah .\nMm .\nand that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price ,\nYep .\nokay .\nOkay . Well that's that's\nMy m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected .\nYep .\nActually yeah ,\nSo .\nwe we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah .\nMm .\nYeah .\nYep . So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe\nOkay .\nand see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "battery, electronics, a_a_, chip, budget", "dialogue_id": 95}, {"text": "Okay , good .

Cool .\nUm and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? N\nMm um . No , I don't think so .\nNo ? Okay , cool .\nNo .\nThen we shall start with a presentation from Raj .\nYeah .  Hi , me Raj , again . Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . So we have to look on this . First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way   We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . So what are our findings ? In our  uh in our findings we have seen that  when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take  in designing our rem uh remote controls .\nThe last one is the most important one , is it ?\nNo the first one is the\nOh , sorry .\nuh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook ,\nOkay .\nthe fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good .\nOkay .\nThe second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that .\nSo that indicates our technological advancement . And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use ,\nMm-hmm .\nlike it shouldn't be too much co complicated ,\nMm-hmm .\nthere shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . And it should be uh  and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . So that they could know how to use these remote controls . When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh  our recent fashion update shows that\nSorry .\nAh yeah ?\nI was just reading fruit and vegetables .\nHard to know how we are going to incorporate that .\nY yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes ,  and everything with fruits and vegetables ,\nbecause the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic ,\nOkay . Yeah .\nWe should make a big sponge lemon ,\nbecoming\nand then it'd be it would be yellow .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nIt's\nSo\nTh that's very good .\nYeah .\nYeah . So something like that we we should do .\nGlow-in-the-dark . Okay .\nAnd people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look .\nMm .\nWell , that's good .\nYeah . Yeah .\nThat's what we kind of predicted anyway .\nSo so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . So that should also be taken into consideration .\nOkay . Okay .\nSo these are my views .\nOkay .\nSo\nOkay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can\nNo it ca  y a\nDo you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ?\nThe rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co\nOkay . Quite disposable .\nYeah . 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also ,\nOkay .\nbecause our company is very well  for taking all these concerns into consideration ,\nAlright , okay .\nOh okay .\nso we don't want to have any harm to the society ,\nUh-huh . Okay .\nso\nFashion .\nMm 'kay .\nCool .\nSo that's all .\nFruit and veg , well there you go .\nJust what I think of when I think of a remote control .\nMm .\nA remote control ? Yeah .\nAnd were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ?\nS uh we didn't find out any such point .\nOr was it just  Okay .\nUh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so\nMm-mm-mm-mm .\nCool .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "trend, meeting, trends, market, presentation", "dialogue_id": 96}, {"text": "Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm .\nF_ , what is it ? Um .\nFunction F_ eight .\nyeah .\nHmm .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nOh no ,   .\nNo signal . Is that  ?\nNo , it's got it's got it .\nYeah , uh yeah , uh yeah .\nYeah .\nExcuse me .\nOkay , and then F_ five , right ?\nUh , yeah  .\nOkay . Um okay , so the interface concept um . Yeah . The interface specification , what people  um how they interact with it basically , I think . Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the  what's good about them , what's bad about them , um I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Um and what  the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination .\nMm 'kay .\nUh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well .\neither .\nHmm .\nYeah .  Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something .\nUh okay .\nUm and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . So I think for our remote control  There is some inconsistency already in  ec existing in  between remote controls , but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something ,\nRight , okay . Yeah .\nI think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use .\nAnd we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you .\nExcellent .\nDo I press Escape F_ five ? Or just\nUh no just escape should uh\nEscape , okay . Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . Yeah , okay . So these are the  some of the pictures of existing ones .\nWow .\nI'll just walk you through them . This one is a voice recognition .\n'Kay .\nAnd that's the kind of idea we're going for .\nLooks pretty complicated .\nThere's um an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could  I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us .\nRight , okay .\nThis one is  got a kind of scroll like a mouse ,\nMm-hmm , like the middle button .\nwhich  Yeah .\nOkay .\nUm and  But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that ,\nAh it's kinda like scrolling\nlike would the computer come\nuh right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um  menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll .\nUh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one ,\nRight , okay .\nis it ? But the one below that has got like  a little scroll function on the side . But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen .\nYeah .\nYeah , presumably .\nI think that's what that is . So these are just a few ideas . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one .\nUh it looks threatening .\nYeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet .\nYeah , it does look kind of dangerous .\nIt looks like yeah  .\nHmm .\nUm this one I thought was really cool . It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about .\nYou can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool .\nOkay .\nAnd that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . I think something like that would be good .\nWow .\nYeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um  , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .\nOf course yellow .\nSo like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever .\nRight , yeah . Yeah , that's true . Yeah . Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky .\nYeah .\nI don't think that will sell very well .\nI mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ?\nI guess so . I don't know .\nThen d blind don't watch T_V_ .\nStrange .\nI think that's a bit   Yeah exactly .\nNo they do , they do .\nThey do ?\nThey listen to it . Yeah .\nYeah . And um this one  is just pointing out . I like  some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but  pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .\nRight , okay .\nSo that could  that's a bit confusing . Um but the buttons on this I think are  it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . They don't have to be all the same . So that's quite cool . Um .\n'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ?\nYeah , exactly . Um F_ five . Yes . So there are some of the findings . So we need to combine those ones um\nand I've just got  an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in .\nBrilliant . That's handy .\nUm yeah it is , just in time , very handy .

So that's quite cool . Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the\nThe L_C_D_\nYeah .\nand the other stuff uh , I think .\nAnd the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition ,\nBut in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more ,\nare we ?\nbut they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new .\nUh-huh .\nOkay .\nUh yeah .\nUh-huh . But our budget , we've\nIt's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market .\nUh-huh . Okay .\nOkay .\nI'm not sure if the  if  for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost ,  .\nBen bana\nYeah . I can't see tha Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got  I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now ,\nThe L_C_D_ .\nso that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small\nBut I mean like I I  the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough .\nYeah .\nUm but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have  now have colour L_C_D_ screens ,\nNo .\nHmm .\nw I ju I mean\nYeah . S\nI wouldn't know about the costs of them .\nUh-huh .\nBut uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ?\nAnd the\nTwelve fifty .\nUh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa\nPossibly .\nYeah , that's the thing , because\nBut but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? You're looking at the T_V_\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand and it's uh\nYeah .\nThat's true , yeah .\nIt just seems kind of like a a needless th\nAnd one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ .\nRight .\nIt's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the um  the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of  we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "budget, speech, costs, technological, cost", "dialogue_id": 96}, {"text": "So which vegetable ?\nWell I mean we could make a\nYeah , I know , carrot  .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nWell , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s\nThe the lemon . Well what are the options ?\nYeah .\nAnd if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon .\nBut we don't want it to be  Yeah . Um the child-friendly , yeah . Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff .\nMm-hmm . I like I like the colourful buttons as well .\nI think that's a good idea to go for . Yeah . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um .\nYeah . I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five ,\nYeah .\nso most people will have come in contact with that kind of use .\nS yeah . So they'd be able to use that um , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen .\nYeah .\nUm so there you go .\nAnd that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so\nYeah .\nOh .\nSo that's um the user interface\n'Kay .\ndesign .\nOkay .\nSo okay , I'll take this out now then .\nUm so\nThere you go .\nI guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among ,\nYeah , looks like it .\nand I'll I'll give you the uh ,  I guess , technical considerations for those .\nMm .\nUh\nAnd I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it  .\nYeah , I was just thinking the self same thing .\nRight . So , the way I'm gonna do this  is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it ,\nand then we'll throw in our new innovations um  and keep it all within budget .\nMagic man .\nSo uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . Um this is what they sent me . 'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose .\nUm you open it up , there's a circuit board inside ,\nMm-hmm .\num  and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch\nSo this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ?\nRight , it's very  they're very cheap remote . This remote costs nothing , you know . Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end ,\nMm-hmm .\nand that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television .\nRight .\nOh here it is .  Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh\nOkay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ?\nR Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make .\nThey gotta be   Almost a key-ring .\nRight . So this is what we need to have for certain .\nOkay .\nUm . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . So lots of choices ,\n'Kay .\nwhat do we think ? Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right .\nWell .\nMm . I'm not sure about the sponge .\nOrganic sponge .\nWell , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it .\nUh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure .\nUm  Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability\nYeah .\nand\nYeah .\nUm .\nand ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast .\nYeah so\nUm  so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic  initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ?\nOkay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex\nI like the rubber , the stress balls , I think ,\nOh right , okay .\nyou know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and\nOh right .\nI don't know what that stuff is .\nSo something with give to it .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay . And\nAnd that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around .\nand the colour is yellow , right ?\nYeah ,\nOr at least incorporating , yeah .\ny  yellow incorporated , yeah .\nYellow  , okay . Um .\nI mean I forgot i we're sort of uh  I don't know what other standard silver kind of\nI think\nOther parts or uh\nMm . Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours\nMm-hmm .\nMm' kay .\nor i if we're having buttons actually ,\nSo yellow for the body ,\nI don\nUm .\nand then what colour for the buttons ?\nUm I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself .\nYeah .\nSo multi-coloured buttons .\nYou do have ones like um play  could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah .\nYeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .\nMakes it easy to use . Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish .\nOkay .\nYeah .  Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel  I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use ,\nOkay .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah .\na bit comfier , you know .\nYeah .\nMm 'kay so the shape we wanna go  Um how exactly ? Maybe double\nLike uh  an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of ,\nYeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be  that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it .\nor just like a  It's not\nWhat about a banana ?\nYeah .\nWe could make novelty remote controls .\nYeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control ,\nWell , yeah , I mean like\n'cause it's yellow fruit ,\nright ?\nYeah , yeah . Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah .\nYeah . But then how would you point it ?\nAh\nyeah . Mm-hmm .\nHow would you point it ?\nOh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess .\nWhat\nWe could have a little L_E_D_s on each end .\nYeah , I appreciate this idea ,\nThey only cost pennies .\nbecause then this   this will help us in our advertisement also\nand we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . That what our data shows that , so this w this w\nYeah .\nHuh ?\ny I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea .\nUm .\nSo a spongy banana re\nI mean that that th\nRubber banana .\nYeah .\ndoes\nOkay .\nit does seem a bit uh again childish maybe .\nYeah .\nOkay , okay .\nI think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ?\nUh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables ,\nS\nSee\nlike people uh now\nAnd sponginess .\nSo maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable\nAnd spongy , yeah .\nSpongy .\nYeah .\nlike so it would have a stem perhaps\nYeah .\nand a\nMaybe , yeah .\nmaybe a  it'd be s axially symmetric .\nHuh .\nLike what's what's that  , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like  looks like a little snowman kind of thing . I don't know the name of that .\nSo it'd look like this kinda .\nYeah , that's what I was thinking .\nLike a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?\nUh .\nYeah , maybe that's what they are .\n'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit\nYeah ,\nand\nand it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end .\nYeah .\nYeah , why the hell not .  Let's  that'll make us fifty million Euros .\nI don't know . What do you guy  What do you think ?\nUm . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape ,\nNo .\nYeah .\nyeah ?\nYeah .\nYeah , then only we can relate it with something .\nYeah , we can relate it by advertising or\nYeah . Exactly .\nOkay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ?\nYeah .\nOr we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want .\nUh-huh .\nOkay .\nThere's a good man . There's a good idea .\nOkay .\nOkay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy .\nYeah , sure . I will be happy to do that .\nWe'll uh  Okay , we could do that . Um .\nOkay . And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ?\nUm I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop .\nMm .\nOkay , so\nThey've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um\nso buttons .\nthings that are always used .\nOkay , just like that .\nThat's cool .\nYeah .\nI like it .\nOkay .\nUm .\nWith the scroll-wheel or no ?\nYeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ?\nUh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably .\nOkay uh I could put the microphone here .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay there's the microphone .\nYeah .\nWhere should I put the microphone ?\nI mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ?\nYeah , I'm not sure . Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think .\nGlad , we're not doing this for real .\nUm yeah , I can  no I'm not sure .\nOkay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ?\nI couldn Yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nAnd uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is  the microphone\nOkay .\nYeah .\nSo should the microphone be just anywhere on it or\nI would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's  Yeah .\nYeah .\n'Kay there's the mic .\nSo it can be sort of held and w\nThat's cool .\nWe really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition .\nUm n well we can  Whoops .\nOops .\nUm .\nUm .\nSo let's not use the whiteboard any more .\nYeah .\nUm .\nUpsidaisy .\nOops , sorry . Okay .\nAnd uh so what else was there ? Um the\nWhat about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ?\nI s I still like it .\nAre we just gonna leave that ?\nUm but that's me .\nYou still like it . 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system .\nRight .\nYes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes .\n'Cause um it could  Yeah .\nUm don't wanna sort of overkill .\nEspecially with yellow  .  Mm . I dunno .\nHmm .\n'Cause I mean like uh if we  I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ?\nThen you put it in the fruit bowl ?\nThey can work from a\nYeah , you know , and then you just tal\nYou don't have to hold it .\nI mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nI it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers ,\nUm .\nyou know they have uh fruits all round them .\nYeah .\nYeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah .\nNow just make sure they don't eat the remote .\nYeah .\nI mean uh  some uh I\nYeah , do we need buttons ?\nl like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple .\nMm .\nThen it's just apple so sort of\nYeah .\nUh , yellow apples though  Hmm .\nI quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite  got a quite steady base .\nYeah . Okay , yeah , that's good .\nOkay . But yeah\nGroovy .\nUm\nand as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know .\nYeah ,  .\nBut yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close .\nIt can sit at a distance and pick it up still .\nYeah . So  I mean like you could actually\nOkay .\nOr we can\nYeah , gives you the options .\nwe can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece .\nMm-hmm .\nSo whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay ,\nMm-hmm .\nSo a selection of casings .\nMm-hmm .\nit will look l  Uh yeah . In that w\nIt kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um\nYeah , 'cause you said about disposable ,\nS s sorry ?\ndidn't you ? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things\nUh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover ,\nso we could do that , like have a choice . Yeah .\nokay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look .\nLike like mobiles , yeah .\nYeah .\nIf somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put  we will put apple shape casing on that . It will give apple shape look . So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want ,\nOkay .\nOkay .\nwithout  uh yeah .\nWe still need the buttons in the same places thought ,\nYeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side .\ndon't we ?\nYou can standardise those , I mean .\nYeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing ,\nOh , that's the other side . Oh , okay .\nso half of that will be look the\nOh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay .\nYeah , not not the upper side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of  from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever .\nOkay , okay .\nSo in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape .\nYeah yeah .\nAnd\nI think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons ,\nOkay .\n'cause when  if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really\nMm mm .\nYou know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it ,\nYeah .\nunless you have sort of  you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe .\nOkay , um so\nSo you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options .\nYeah ,\ns I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel ,\nYeah .\nand the colours we got down ,\nYeah .\nand the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or\nYeah .\nYeah . Well , um because  Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because  what\nOkay , so we stick with what we've got there .\nYeah , w I think wh wha would  we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a  too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that ,\nMm 'kay .\nbecause al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nI mean we could make it nice pale yellow .\nWell , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nSo again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different\nOkay . Yeah .\ncolour , but have\nMaybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan .\nkinda going round , yeah .\nMm .\nUm I mean e even if\nBecause\nI mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together .\nYeah .\nSo you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .\nYeah . Yeah . Uh-huh .\nMm-hmm .\nW sort of\nGreat .  Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . We can use a hand-dynamo . Um I don't know what that means , we crank it ?\nUh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda  powers it .\nRight , it's like those watches that you c\nUh yeah .\nSo , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power .\nOh , a d a dynamo ?\nYeah ,  .\nYeah , I like that , yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist .\nYeah .\nYeah that's quite cool .\nOkay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing .\nBut\nOkay . You shake it and scream at it .\nBut but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ?\nYeah .\nYeah , it is , yeah .\nBecause then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat\nIt does leave them with an obligation to\nYeah , to mo Yeah .\nEspecially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated .\nYeah ,\nRight .\nbecause most of the people\nThen if it's just sitting on the\nYeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then  Yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay , okay .\nOkay .\nThat's true .\nRight um what are the other options ?\nUh there's solar power . Um .\nUh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand the days when there is no sola sunlight\nI'm I'm with uh Raj on that ,\nOkay , so probably just\nYeah . Yeah .\nI think , you know ,\nWhat we w\nI've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window .\nyeah . I think we should  a rechargeable  battery will be a good idea .\nBut w  like just normal light ?\nOh that's true .\nThey can they can recharge it .\nI mean I w I w uh\nthat idea that I thought  um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother\nMm .\nis having a ,\nAnd we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ?\nyeah ,\nYeah .\nhaving a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as  uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\n'Kay .\nLike like a hand  like one of those portable phones kind of thing .\nYeah , that's  Yeah , exactly .\nYeah that kind of thing .\nOkay . So uh a rechargeable battery  .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay . Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already .\nRechargeable .\nMm .\nUm .\n. What's chip on print ? What's\nHmm ?\nSorry , never mind .\nUh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um  Oops , this one . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in ,", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "buttons, carrot, lemon, vegetables, vegetable", "dialogue_id": 96}, {"text": "Mm-hmm .\nwhich adds to the cost as you can expect .\nMm-hmm .\nUm . But uh I think we can keep it all under budget . So uh yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through .\nMm-hmm .\nSo just in time .\nYeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping .\nJust in time .\nRight , right .\nThat's good .\nYeah ,\nUh woah .\nand keeping the L_C_D_ screen out .\nOkay , we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um  Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing .

It's you guys . Yeah .\nOh neat .\nCool .\nSo um , you know I mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah . Mm .\nUm and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches .\nOkay .\nOkay . Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ?\nThat's great .\nUh yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWhich doesn't really help me much .\nI think , I've saved mine already .\nYeah , can you save that  uh send that last one again , please , Raj ,\nYeah .\nas I still can't find it on the\nUh it was under a different name .\nI will show you , in shared documents .\nOkay .\nUh working components  . Oh , you didn't get that . I will send new .\nNo . Okay , thank you .\nUh I'll put it in shared documents , again .\nUm yeah , Project , Project Documents .\nProject documents , sorry , I put it in the shared documents .\nUh right ,\nUh yeah .\nthat's that's the that  it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . Project Documents is on the um  desktop .\nRight , that's great .

S  Um presumably there's clay somewhere . Um .  Four .\nYeah , that's great .\nWhoops . Light , light , please . Light .  Right , there you go .\nYeah , th thank you .\nYeah , quite . And we're using this our basic chip set , so it's all good .\nOh sorry .\nAre we done with our meeting ?\nUh excuse me , Brian .\nUm I think we're almost done , yeah .\nYeah .\nYou have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen .\nOh oops .\nS\nSorry man . Uh okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and  Uh . Apples .  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . 'Kay , so we came up with that , that's okay . What's supplements ? Supplements . Uh  uh .  See .\nCool . Fun .\nI shoulda  something like that . If I kn see I I knew that . I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape .\nHmm .\nJust for cruelty .\nHmm .\nYeah . Star fruit .\nI wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything .\nSo sh should Should we leave now , Brian ?\nNo . Oh yeah , we can do buttons .\nOr we are going to discuss something ?\nUm . Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions  or confusions ,\nNo I'm good .\n'cause I'm confused .\nYeah .\nHuh ?\nOkay .\nExcuse me .\nUm uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a\nMm .\nSorry . Thank you . Yeah .\nThere we go . Warning , finish meeting now .\nSo .\nI rounded it up far too fast .  Um  . Where are we going ? My Documents , that's not what I want . My Project Documents .  There we go .", "topic_id": 4, "keywords": "mics, buttons, techno, speech, l_c_d_", "dialogue_id": 96}, {"text": "Hello , uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control .\nHello .\nMm-hmm .\nHello .\nUm the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So , uh we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . So , who wants to start ? Okay .\nI s\nOkay .\nNo , no , you you can start .\nSo start , uh\nOkay , I'll start . Can you open my presentation ,\nplease .\nUh .\nI'm number four .\nThis one ?\nTrend . Yep . Can you pass the mouse , please .  Oh okay , that's fine .\nTurn .\nOkay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you  present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .  Um  so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority .\nHmm .\nHmm .\nSecondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control .  From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . So ,  I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .\nOkay .\nUm so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way .\nWhat does it mean , spongy ?\nUh sort of um squishy .\nLike soft , or something ?\nUm . Yeah soft ,\nlike a uh like a sponge .\nLike a sponge .  Yeah .\nI don't know . Yeah .\nOkay . I will see .\nUm so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it .  Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel .\nOkay .\nAnd that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our  of th the Real Reaction company . Um .\nYeah , uh yeah .\nThat's it .\nEasy to use , is it uh a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . It's less important , right ?\nLess important .\nYeah yeah .\nSo um fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology ,\nOkay .\nand half important as technology is easy to use . So .\nSo , Hamed , can you  .\nYeah . The second one . Could you please show the presentation number three .\nMm-hmm .\nI think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature .\nUm . Number ?\nWe'll see .\nYeah .\nThree .\nThree .\nThis one ?\nYes .  Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . Uh , n n no , it's the first one . The second one .\nSo it's not this one .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, presentation, remote, talking, start", "dialogue_id": 97}, {"text": "Uh yeah . Okay .  Okay . So I am going to talk about  a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um  generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be  we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control .  Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can  which should be taken easily in hand . It should not be completely like uh a cube . It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier .\nExactly .\nAnd maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . Not on remote control . I dunno if I can explain well . But uh just inside . For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . So it can be another uh preference . And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . Okay . That's mine .\nOkay .\nUh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as\nOkay , so could you please , Fabien , open it .\nYeah .\nI'm person two . And which one , uh probably the first one . I'm not sure but check the first one . I  Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but\nThis one , yeah .\nYeah , that's it . Just  It's only this slide ? Yeah . This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just\nInch .\nYeah , seven seven inch T_  T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme .\nOh ,  .\nThis is this is the stuff that I can use to\nOops .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "buttons, button, remote, control, useful", "dialogue_id": 97}, {"text": "Okay , so the  this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . So there will be some circuit uh for the power . So , say power circuit here . Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh  And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . So no problem . There can be also solar cell . Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design .\nMm-hmm .\nSo at least seven to seven . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it .\nIt doesn't matter . Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . So this will be T_F_T_ . And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here . Interface to the microphone . Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So infra-red here . So the  once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be  which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . Um I have to check what I wanted to  Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device .\nCan you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem .\nA all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically .\nYep .\nBut we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes  if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe ,\nOkay . So\nI dunno .\nWell maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .\nSo\nOkay . Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around .  maybe after .\nWell , it's maybe related to the U_I_ .\nSo\nYeah .\nCa Can I ask a question .\nA Yeah , that's all from me .\nThis seven inch T_F_T_ screen ,\nYeah ?\nhow big is it in reality ?\nWell , seven to seven inches .\nSo like that .\nYes .\nThat's quite big .\nUh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ?\nNo , I don't think it's seven by seven ,\nYeah but\nI think it's seven  the diagonal is seven .\nTo be honest , I was\nUsually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal .\nYeah yes  .\nBut I mean even even that is like this big .\nYeah .  I dunno I dun I dun One each\n. But , yeah ,  .\nYeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially ,\nYeah .\nbut it's seven inches . But I I think we can we can cut it .\nYou can cut the T_F_T_ screen .\nLet's go .\nYeah , no no problem ,\nbecause because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth .\nSo let's cut the T_F_T_ .\nSo\nYeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen .\nMm .\nOkay , so\nSo so for the same price we have four screens now  .\nMm .\nOkay .\nThese technical engineers , huh .\nSo , what's the size of the device ?\nAh well this is like this is almost nothing . Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .\nEven from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still\nYeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .\nIs it  Can you hold that , or ?\nBecause if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know .\nWhat user wants . He wants a small remote control , or ? Uh uh with big buttons .\nUh .\nI thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .\nYeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand .\nIt's difficult .\nYes .\nA sm\nBut is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ?\nW I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow  Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah ,\nSo maybe you can finish your presentation ,\nand afterwards we will discuss about all this .\nbut  Oh , okay .\nMaybe this  .\nOkay .\nOkay thanks  .\nThat's it . Okay . So .   No . Uh , so I think we have a lot  We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ?", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "microphone, speech, device, batteries, battery", "dialogue_id": 97}, {"text": "Not  J uh just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ ,\nOkay .\nso no problem in energy , I think .\nSo  Okay .\nBut we have to use the solar cell .\nSo but\nUh like\nOtherwise not .\nbut using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery\nYeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells .\nOkay . Uh one two\nSo like three to five centimetres ,\nOkay .\nI dunno exactly , but .\nSo if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ?\nS Uh d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight , you know .\nOkay .\nThe television lights .\nYeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but .\nMm-hmm .\nAt least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ .\nYeah from the T_\nYeah .\nI don't think it's enough , uh .\nI dunno .\nOkay .\nOkay . Mm .\nAh it's a it's a compromise , no ?\nAt least it's new and maybe technology New technology .\nYeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things .\nIt's it's quite innovative , yes .\nYeah .\nHmm .\nUm .\nAnd if you watch T_V_ outside it's  very useful .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "solar, batteries, lights, energy, light", "dialogue_id": 97}, {"text": "So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case .\nUh what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other  what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen .\nUh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem . Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ?\nMm . I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . So let's say an average size , okay ,\nMm .\nand it should not be very heavy also . And I prefer to  is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . So we c it's like like some joysticks . You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So the general shape should be like this . I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . So uh seven  not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's  that's my opinion . It's easier .\nOkay .\nWhich is the same area .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nCould you re could you redesign your board ?\nFive to ten . Well that\nOh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres .\nYeah , right .\nYeah .\nYeah , I think it's feasib Well one um um  How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand .\nMm-hmm .\nLike holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . Well  But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit .\nOh . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible .\nWell fi five to ten it would be feasible .\nMm .\nOkay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible .\nOkay . So we are agree with a small\nI'll make it .\nOr uh or I don't know\nL_C_D_ .\nFo Five by ten .\nbut I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers .\nYeah .\nTouching the screen . Something like\nTactile or something , yeah .\nMm like tactile .\nMm , touch screen .\nTouch screen , yeah .\nSo  But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better ,\nYeah .\nbecause\nThe problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new .\nMm-hmm .\nSo let's go for a small L_C_D_ .\nSo\nOkay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me\nA smaller s\nYeah okay .\nOkay .\nSo , five by s ten .\nand I will work it out .\nHmm .\nUm so what about , so the case we talked about . Um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the  it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and\nSeven to ten banana .\nA big banana .\nOkay . Rather mango or something or .\nUm .\nWell it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .\nYeah . Yeah .\nI mean what other what other fruit and vegetables\nBut it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but\nDo you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ?\nYeah .\nI dunno if it can fit with the technology . You are the specialists of that .\nYou mean banana .\nWell , but  If it's    If it  If the banana is big enough .\nSo\nThen , yes .  But if you want to look at the screen  , no . Well\nYeah , and\nI think this  is not good .\nThe screen has to be  square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves .\nWell , it can be whatever you want .\nIt could .\nBut if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .\nYeah .\nMm .\nIt's like more more expensive to have shape like that . But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement .\nWell  I'd like a shaped screen . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen .\nOkay\nOkay\nokay .\nMm .\nYeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one .\nYeah . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not  doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana .\nBut\nLike modified banana , okay .\nSo we are agree with the banana thing ?\nWell it  we'll stick to banana , or ?\nOkay .\nYeah , banana's good .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nMm-mm .", "topic_id": 4, "keywords": "joysticks, joystick, screens, device, screen", "dialogue_id": 97}, {"text": "So ,  the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess .\nYeah , I think infra-red .\nEverybody's agreed .\nYeah , yeah . Sure .\nUh , so that's it I think about the concepts . You have other thing to add to this point , or uh no ? So , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons . I don't know what we are going to do with that . You talked about the buttons on the side\nLike like peeling of the banana you s\nYeah , peeling of the banana .\nMm what ?\nIt would be cool , yeah .\nPeeling of the banana , you know ,\nYeah .\nshould should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .\nYeah .\nMm .\nOkay . And you mean the first layer would be spongy .\nYeah .\nFirst layer obviously spo Yeah ,\nSo\nw It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think .\nIs it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ?\nUh\nLike doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it .\nI think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that ,\nYeah .\nyou know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah , some  Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . So , something like this .\nYeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or .\nWell is it possible to make it soft ?\nYeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so .\nYeah .\nSo I think if it's so then it's cool ?\nSo , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .\nI think for sure . Definitely . The softer the better .\nYeah .\nCool .\nYeah .\nHonestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far ,\nYeah .\nbut it will be terrible .\nUm . And setting buttons hidden in  .\nMm .\nMm , other remarks , or something , or . Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or . I think we are almost there  . Uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or .\nAnd how\nMm-hmm .\nPof .\nWe could use Velcro .\nYeah , maybe .\nOr uh ma maybe a magnetic\nYes , yeah  it's a good idea .\nthing .\nMa magnetic  oh .\nMagnetic  . Mm . Yeah or a  Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh  materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .\nOkay .\nAnd when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana .\nOkay . And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or\nYeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing .\nYeah , yeah , yeah .\nIn a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel . Maybe .\nWell since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b uh  So we need that the that the peeling  uh I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So that we can reach the energy out of it  out of that .\nMm .\nMm . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and\nIt is possible , but , well if it\nAnd a and a banana .\nI dunno .\nMm .\nI dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside .\nHmm .\nYeah .\nBut then it must be some window there , you know .\nOkay .\nMm .\nAnd something we forgot , maybe , uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ?\nYes , I think . I think so .\nI think it's important .\nIt i Yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great .\nI think  One of our p priorities is tech technology .\nSo we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on ,\nMm .\nAnd\nMm-hmm .\nand we have also the technology thing w will be . And even the easy to use thing ,\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nso it will be perfect .\nMm .\nSo we add also the speech recognition device .\nYeah .\nYeah . I agree .\nSo , that great . We have decided everything . And think we are on a good way . So , um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes .

I am the Industrial Designer .\nAnd I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader .  Alright okay , so tool training . Um .  Project plan . So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required ?\nTool training\nI'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training .\nNeither am I  .\nOh I see , so we shouldn't really be  Oh right okay , so . So we have the project team , which is to um  basically to come up with a new r remote control device .\nUh we have uh  the starting base was the original  which has been in existence now for a period of time . And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to  to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience .\nYeah .\nSo um  method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh  the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . So um  in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this uh this device .\nYes .\nAnd uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before . And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day . Um and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end .\nMm-hmm , okay .\nSo we've got tool training . Try out whiteboard . Uh .  So we will um .\nRight so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works . So uh I don't know who wishes to go first .\nOkay  .\nDo you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever .\nI don't mind .\nI dunno .\nUm .\nAh uh .\nLet's see .\nGood job I got pockets today .\nBut now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera .\nYour microphone's just\nI take it that\nAre we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ?\nI would  I would guess so . Or\nYeah . I don't know .\nYou've lost uh your microphone there .\nTechnical problems .\nOh . Right here we go .\nI mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things .\nOkay . I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . Little smiley cat there . Um and this would be because they're very independent , uh they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe .\nUm  and they can be very very affectionate . Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats . Um . Um and they can look after themselves .\nNext .\nOkay , yeah . I'll I'll\nShall I rub that out , actually ?\nI don't see as there's any need to . There's plenty of space .\nI mean whatever .\nWe can have have a whole menagerie .\nExactly .\nShall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything . Okay .\nWe've had more time to prepare over this side ,\nThere's one .\nso we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets .\nDidn't think of that .\n'Kay uh\nThe three pens are underneath .\npens are over here . I'll try the red pen . Okay . Um .  I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm  be able to draw very well ,\nYou get marks for artistic impression .\nbut I'll have a bash at it .\nUh .\nOoh ooh  I lost it there . I think I've just knocked the microphone .  Um .\nSo you're just doing the face .\nWe'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear  .\nUm  and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that .\nGreat .\nRight . Hello . Um I'm gonna go for the dog , and I'm gonna draw one badly as well . Uh .  looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something .\nThat's quite good .\nRight . There's my dog . Um  I like dogs because they're very loyal . And they're always happy , so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited . So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . And they're also good for exercise as well . You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so .\nOkay , that's why I like dogs .\nRight , um .  Well I've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh  I'm not too keen on them anyway . Not to worry . So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw . Uh\nAs you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well .\nAnyway um .  And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . Other than the fact that they keep dying ,\nuh fish are uh  are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance .\nGreat .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "meeting, meetings, meet, tool, agenda", "dialogue_id": 98}, {"text": "Right .

New remote . So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were .\nYes .\nSo uh any any thoughts ?\nUm I  with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons . As that is the main function .\nOkay , so so basically we're looking for some um  we're looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily .\nYes .\nUm we're looking for a device that is uh  What was the other things you said there ?\nUm sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible .\nEasy to use . Use .\nis easy to use and see .\nAnd see .\nYes .\nOkay . Uh .\nCan I just check ?  Is this just a television remote ? Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote .\nOr is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ?\nMm .\nOh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that .\nBut it seems to me sensible ,\n'cause  as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room .\nYeah .\nAnd uh\nSo a device for for all remotes .\nSorry , you go . You go .\nI've Okay . Yeah . Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots . And um sometimes uh they sort of  remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . So  whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room .\nComes to your whistle .\nHmm .\nThat's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but\nYeah .\nBut is it  in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive . You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to\nYeah .\n'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all .\nYeah .\nAnd so these are probably mutually exclusive options\nMm-hmm .\nYes .\nthat uh\nMm-hmm .\nHmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more  with handling them ,\nYeah .\ntherefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on .\nMaybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ?\nBetter instructions .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remotes, remote, buttons, controls, television", "dialogue_id": 98}, {"text": "Yeah .

Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now .\nUh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes . Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control .\nMm-hmm .\nUh , some of the  oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . So now we all know what our\nOkay .\ngoal is . Um , I  oh forget  I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . We all know each other's names . Joost , Guido , Antek .\nWhat is your name ?\nYes .\nYes . Antek .\nAntek Ahmet . And Joost .\nOkay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part .\nOkay . Yeah .\nOkay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that .\nYes .\nYes .\nOkay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um  there's a document folder called um the sh  shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th\nCan we see the white-board on our laptops ?\nNo , no . Just on the on the screen over there .\nNo , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but\nOh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop  . Is is  if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's  I don't know if it's important .\nOkay .\nThis an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here . It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we  well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this . Oh .  If pen is selected , yes .\nOh , no no .\nWith that pen ?\nIt's not  But it is pen . It's not working like a pen yet .\nMm .\nHuh . Huh .\nMm .\nIt's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen .\nLittle bit slower .\nYou can use an eraser . And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . So , it's quite easy . Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics ,\non blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then .\nI'll use this uh same sheet . Alright . Oh , let me think . Different colours . Oh .\nWell , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish .\npiranha . Okay .\nUh .\nMm-hmm . I'm gonna use some different colour  now .\nOh .\nSome  a little white . Looks like a fish . Think it is . Oh .\nOh .  Uh , colour . This is black ? I think so .\nYellow\nOh . Oh , this is just uh  useless uh drawings but\nOh teeth . I need teeth .  Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is .\nHmm .\nOkay . What was uh  I have su to sum up its favourite characteris\nDifferent .\nWell , I like its uh sharp  razor sharp teeth .  Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . And I like its overall uh aggressive look and  Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be .\nOkay .\nWell , who wants to be next ?\nNobody , I guess .\nI will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh\nYou go , Guido ? Okay . Uh , make a new sheet . Uh , it's by pressing on blank .\nBlank ?\nYep .\nOkay . Then pen again ?\nYep .\nOkay .\nAnd uh  so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths .\nOkay , um\nFormat .\ncontrol . Uh  Ah , purple . Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is ,\nbut the easiest animal I can think is is a bird .\nUh I will\nYou know , I thought of that actually .\nThat's my bird .   Yeah ?\nYeah .\nIsn't it quite  it's a little bit light .\nUh , another colour maybe . A red one .\nA small one . Uh , line width . Two ? Three . Oh that's okay . That's another one .\nWell , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds .\nAno  Uh  uh  it's a\nIts simplicity .\nYeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think .\nUm , I don't know . Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that .\nOh , okay . Okay .\nMaybe a little bit . Yeah . I don't know .\nOkay . No , uh it's clear .\nSo  more uh birds ?\nN no  no .\nWe get your point . Okay . Who wants to be next ?\nOkay ,  okay ,  okay .\nYeah , whatever . I'll go next .\nThanks .\nM\nI haven't got a favourite animal too , so\nPictionary .\nOh .  What should I draw ?\nOh .\nA cow .\nOkay .\nThank you ,\nI'll draw a penguin .  Yeah .  I'll draw a penguin . Whatever . I can't draw , so you can start to laugh already .\nI'll do so .\nWhatever . Something like that .\nCome on .\nYeah , it's little bit hard .\nMm hmm hmm , orange .\nOrange , of course .\nWhatever .\nOh ,  it's better than your bird .\nUh yeah .\nEverything's better than your bird .\nYeah .  True .\nWhatever .\nHey , it's blue . No . Whatever . Um , I like its ugliness\nand uh  Yeah , whatever . The way it walks or whatever .\nOkay .\nYour turn .\n'Kay .\nDrawing .\nI'm going to draw a cat . I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal .\nAnd you can have them at home .\nWhich is not as the case with uh with bingwings and\nWell , you can have a piranha at home .\nYe yes ,  yeah .\nHuh .\nOr a line .\nA little bit .\nI mean a bird .\nYeah .  Don't mess with my birds , yeah .\nIt's not very uh   very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it .\nHmm . It's a handicapped cat .\ncat .\nI don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that .\nIt's\nAh , it's not scared . He's crying but\n. Okay .\nHe's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness .\nWhat do you like about it then ?\nUh it's i most cats are small .\nOh , okay .\nYou can handle them .\nOkay . Okay .

Uh should be original  , trendy , and , of course , user friendly .\nMm-hmm .\nSo maybe you wanna make some notes of that .\nOkay .\nOkay ?\nMm-hmm .\nAll right .  Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . Um . That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . Detailed design , same thing basically .\nMm 'kay so  Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nFunctional , conception and detailed .\nI can't write with this thing .\nMaybe we should redesign it .\nYes .\nAfter we've finished the remote control we'll get to that .\nYeah , okay . All right ? Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ?

Would you like it to be smaller , bigger ,\nUh .\nhave more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly  better marked buttons , you know , things like that ?\nYeah , I\nYeah .\nYes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact .\nYeah .\nSmall , right . Mm-hmm .\nYeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system .\nMm-hmm .\nAudio player . Oh . Okay .\nSo it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically .\nYes , exactly Yes .\nHmm .\nYes .\nDivides us\nYeah . Exactly .\nYeah . Yeah .\nAt um twelve fifty Euros per\nWell .\nWell who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that .\nYeah .\nWe certainly can try to  I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .\nIt should be something new  it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have .\nThat's right .\nNow , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design .\nYeah .\nYeah , of course .\nYeah , design should be , yeah  it should be different . All the  almost all the remotes\nLike trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should  different colours or materials or you know .\nYes , exactly .\nYeah , maybe ten  I do yeah , colours\nAre different shapes .\nand al shapes also . Yeah .\nYes .\nUm so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know .\nYes .\nYeah of course yeah .\nYeah okay , friendly shape , that would help .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remotes, buttons, remote, control, controlling", "dialogue_id": 100}, {"text": "I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap ,\nYes .\nbecause I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it .\nThat is true ,\nbecause they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever .\nYeah .\nAnd and they  suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my  my remote control yeah ?\nMm-hmm .\nWell or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal .\nSo some\nYeah , some beep or something like that ,\nYeah . Mm-hmm .\nOr a b\nUh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink .\nso that we can go\nSo if lost  If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know .\nShould ha\nYeah .\nA fluorescent signal , yeah .\nMm 'kay .\nYeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is .\nExactly , I mean just  that's what I'm saying .\nYeah , yeah . May not be beep .\nI'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or\nBeep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light .\nAnd do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond  what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?\nOkay , my  my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it  a light s sensors , you know ?\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nIn in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep ,\nOkay so\nYes .\nOkay .\nI mean , that we can discuss that later , you know .\nYeah , probably  yeah , probably it's a  yeah , yeah .\nYeah . And uh\nSo the light sensor would activate the signal .\nThat's right . You know there would be\nMm-hmm .\nright you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off ,\nMm-hmm .\nYes .\nbut I think they only work to certain degree and\nBut it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it .\nWhat with\nYeah , of course , that didn't\nThen , in that case\nWell , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly .\nI i we can't do it .\nOh yeah well , but then those people  we can't help everybody .\nI mean it could be on  well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table\num  ,\nOkay we have uh", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "beep, beeps, signal, remote, clap", "dialogue_id": 100}, {"text": "you know , well  maybe we have to move along , okay .\nyeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here .\nYeah , good point .\nOkay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes .

Good morning , Ruud .\nGood morning .\nUh it's important um\nI shall close the door .\nyeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . Okay . Okay . Um we're here to develop uh a new product .\nUm I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ?\nThat's correct .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nUm  we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .\nAlright .\nOkay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?\nThere is ? Yeah , there is .\nOkay .\nNo problem .\nUm okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .\nOkay .\nThe market , we should have a look at the market . Um  we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the   the the progressions , yes .\nProgressions .\nUm the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific  uh specification of that . Um  the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .\nIt's for the vision . Yeah .\nUm and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it  keep it with the functional design .  Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation .  Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um  to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system .  Um yeah , I will show that now . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh\nSensors .\nsensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um well , it  it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . Okay , so not too fast writing . Um  you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day .  Um you can use the eraser to make something go away .\nBut we all use the same white-board file\nYes .\nSo we can work together on it while we're\nYeah .\nor should we only use it in the in the meetings ?\nYeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .\nYeah , okay .\nIt's really like like a regu regular whiteboard .\nYeah , alright . Yep .\nUm you can choose the format , um  sorry . Uh  Let me see . Um  Well   I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um  to um  oh well , I'm  I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training  um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected .\nOkay . Um green .\nAn animal . Okay . Um\nUh a wee rabbit .\nIt's a bunny .\nA rabbit . Okay , well great .\nAlright .\nUm Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .\nBut of course , Flores .\nBlank .\nSebastian is thinking about the animal .\nI'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal .\nOkay .\nYeah , I'm think about it too .  Format  . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but  it works ,\nWell , I'll give it a try .\nYeah .\nIt it should be a cat .\nright ?\nOkay ?\nMm .\nI'm guessing a horse .\nVery good .\nWith a very small  legs .\nI was very good in drawing .\nYou should feed that uh that animal .\nWell , I guess you uh get the idea .\nYes , okay .  Beautiful .\nBeautiful .\nOkay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions  well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um  the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number .  Um\nwe uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development ,  um because uh , well , those are important numbers .

Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .

Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .\nUm Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um  how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you .\nMm-hmm .\nH how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?\nWell , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um  Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?\nYep .\nUm so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .\nYes , I think it should be something like that .\nIt's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,\nOkay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,\nright ?\nnot  we're we're  it's not a\nYeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh  don't have the information for it .\nWe're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?\nNo . No .\nNo ,\nNo , okay .\nwe're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUh Ruud , y do you agree ?\nYeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .\nOkay . Okay .\nUm  Well , the techni fu technical function uh   what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function .\nYeah .\nSo that was my  really my part for uh this session . Um\nSo is that ease of use or uh is that more like um\nYeah .\nWell , that's just the fu the technical function is  pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .\nMm-hmm .\nIt just should change the T_V_'s state .\nOkay .\nSo that's it . Um but furthermore\nAnd you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?\nYeah . Yeah , with buttons .\nOr are there any o other controls ?\nYeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or\nAre there only  any other cont Well ,\nBut\nI I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .\nYeah .\nUh-huh .\nYou know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch\nThey're very vu vulnerable .\nw yes ,\nYeah .\nto to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea ,\nYeah .\nI don't know .\nAnd for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,\nMm-hmm .\nso you must  point everywhere , so maybe infrared is\nOkay .\nMaybe not even pointed . Yeah .\nYeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .\nOkay\nMm-hmm .\nUh\nUh is that uh  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .\nYeah , if you g if you go to radio or or  yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in  outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nOkay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting\nOkay .\nBut  Yeah .\nOkay .\num\nTwo more things .\nokay .\nUm You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um   you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .\nOkay , s yeah .\nYou must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .\nYeah .\nAnd of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um  in dark too .\nOkay .\nSo when it's dark\nThose are two really uh user interface\nUh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha\nYeah .   That's perfect .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nOkay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .\nDo do you\nUm do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the  such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?\nUh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .\nBecause ?\nUh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing .\nMm-hmm .\nBut uh lots of devices already use infrared . So  we'll probably have to implement that .\nOkay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?\nUm well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,\nbut I've seem to forget them   forgot them . Um  oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark .\nYeah .\nUm uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it .\nYeah . Well , maybe I um  but it it can be quite simple ,\nI I don't know .\nyou can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .\nMm-hmm . Okay .\nThe uh the the digits in black .\nMm-hmm .\nUh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy\nOkay .\nwell , it can be for design , of course .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nYeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So\nYes , but there's a cost limitation too .\nYeah ,\nWell , that's more\ntwelve Euro fifty , yeah .\nYeah .\nSo that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .\nOkay .\nThe cost price is very low .\nJust remind something .\nUm\nThe digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .\nOkay , okay .\nYou have a m uh\nOkay . Very good point . Yeah .\nAlways have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks .\nOkay .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "interoperability, remote, communicating, presentation, controls", "dialogue_id": 101}, {"text": "Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily\nMm-hmm . Okay .\num or it should not consume too much um power .

Uh\nWell , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's  it seems to work uh quite okay .\nYeah .\nSo uh technically it will be possible .\nBut you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .\nOkay .

Yep .\nGood . And we have a correct agenda .

Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nWell uh\nGet up stand up .  just\nwe made a prototype .\n'Kay .\nWe first start with the overall uh  This is about the total remote control .\nView .\nWe made it green .\nJust example colour ,\nYeah .\nso uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype .\nIt's a fresh colour . And uh the screen light blue . Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but uh\nOkay ?\nAny questions so far ?\nBig microphone .\nyeah ,\nYeah .\njust uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible .\nOh okay . That's the place where it's going to be , not the size .\nYeah .\nUh well , it's an idea in a  so .\nOh y you  perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh\nDo not forget it .\nUh\nMm-hmm .\nTo function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course .\nHmm .\nYeah , okay . Of course .\nThe microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button .\nMm . Mm , th yeah .\nOkay um\nSmall .\nwe also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um\nYou push the scroll button\nYeah , you push the scroll button\nand it's claps out if there's a\nand a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera .\nRemote settings , et cetera . Yeah .\nSo uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see  oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . Um\nYeah . And you could also touch it so that it comes out ,\nYeah , that's c\nand and use the the the scroll thing as a  with your fingers .\nYeah . Indeed .\nYes .\nOkay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh  which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh  Yes . In an apart uh\nYeah .\nSo a separate button for for text ,\nIn a separate button , yeah .\nYeah .\nokay .\nPerhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah .\nA sign , yeah , just like  Okay , indeed .\nYeah .\nOkay ,\nForgot .\nwe can uh modify that later . Okay . Would you like to make any comments about next uh\nUh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but  It's the button where you can switch channels .  just when you are one and you go to two , you can  or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah .\nPrevious page , yeah , indeed .\nIt has a name . And uh uh we put that in ,\nOh my God .\nI thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute . Uh battery indicator .\nIt's quite large .\nIt's  it's a bit big .\nAnd this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext .\nOkay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh  uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh  when you uh  when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see .\nHuh .\n'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down ,\nMm-hmm .\nso\nYeah . Well this about it , I think .\nOkay . Huh .\nYeah .\nThank you . Looks good .\nI will put it back on the   on the nice green .\nAnd I just missed when I was typing  The R_R_ stands for ?\nThat's the logo of the\nLogo , okay .\nYeah . It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ , but uh\nOkay well\nFull screen .\nI would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course .\nShit .\nYeah .\nAlright .\nSorry .\n'Kay .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "folders, folder, documents, document, presentation", "dialogue_id": 102}, {"text": "Okay , the evaluation criteria ,\nOh full screen , yeah   .\nHuh .\nhuh ?\nEvaluation . 'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we   requirements from the  of the users . My name , my job , okay .\nMy name , my job .\nThe methods . Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false ,\nRight .\nlike question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . One means absolutely not true , seven   means true .\nYeah .\nThe three important things of refa   are uh from th of this year is  are ,\nSorry ,\nyou used the PowerPoint\nis the remote control fancy enough ,\nYeah .\nis it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . And then evaluation itself . Uh .\nWhat ?\nSo .\nBling .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nFirst question . Is the design fancy enough ?\nWell\nProject Manager , what do you think ?\nWell it's  looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided ,\nYeah .\nBut does it\nhuh ?\nYeah .\nOnly what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ?\nIt uh  oh it's in the background . Oh .\nNow uh the single curved idea was uh  Yeah , okay , you ge um\nY you should make uh a sideways uh view .\nYeah . The sideways view , uh that that that ma\nIt will be , I guess . Oh , we can\nHo not that pen .  Not that pen .\nOh\nWell\ng  I would   smart board .\nit might work one time , huh .\nSuppose so .\nUh can I draw here or uh\nThink .\nOoh .\nAh . Oh my God ,\nYeah , yeah , you can .\nSo it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here ,\nit works .\nright ?\nYeah , that's the single curve indeed .\nYeah . So if you v flip it like this .\nOkay .\nYep .\nHere's  yeah .\nThat's not very  i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there ,\nYeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger ,\nso uh\nso that it lays a bit o\nYeah .\nIsn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ?\nYeah , that's a bit of problem maybe .\nNo .\nWith two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think\nYeah . I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing ,\nYeah .\nso if you could\nYeah .\nOkay , indeed . Yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay , but we have to rate uh these things now ?\n'Cause otherwise I think i\nYeah , we have to rate .\nOkay .\nIs it fancy enough ? True is one , false is seven . So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people .\nI think it does .\nI think so .\nI if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it .\nIt's pretty fancy .\nI think   Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now ,\nYeah .\nyou get th\nMm-hmm .\nit's only design .\nI think it does .\nYeah .\nAnd the design .\nWell I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also .\nYeah .\nYeah . I don't know whether older people will use it , but\nVery new thing . Well  Fancy  the old people will .\nSo\nI would make it a two or something .\nA two ?\nYeah .\nIt's true , it's a one .  Very fancy .\nHuh ? Alright , it's a one .  Oh it's a one .\nNo , it's a two .  Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ?\nYeah .\nYeah , I n used  I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't\nBut it's a one uh  Maybe uh\nOkay , no it's two ? True is a one .\nYeah .\nVery true , is it very true or isn't that true ?\nWell I'd say two on a scale\nWell they think it's very true , but uh\nIt's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy ,\nYeah , I think two .\nYeah ,\nso\nbut\nIt's very fancy , I think .\nWe should perhaps\nHave you ever seen a remote control like this ?\nNo , okay well , that's true .\nNo , okay ,\nThat not .\nso so it's fancy .\nThat's fancy enough .\nYeah .\nOkay , one two .\nThen ?\nThat doesn't matter that much , so make it a one .\nYeah .\nOkay . Let's give it a two . Is it innovative ?\nI think it is ,\nEnough .\nYeah\nbecause it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone .\nm\nAnd uh uh the scroll is rubber ,\nIt's from rubber .\nWe have for the search function .\nYeah .\nso s Eno enough to  I think .\nThe scroller a bit  I think it's it's a one yeah .\nIt's a one I think .\nTrue . Also huh uh-huh  the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people .\nYeah , because they're right on your screen . So you can use the b the the arrows . They're right on your screen ,\nHuh .\nso I don't know where you'd search .\nWith the ones\nAre all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons .\nYeah .\nWell , I think they are . The options are it  uh little bit harder ,\nYeah .\nbut if you touch the options then it's uh\nTake a harder look , yeah , sure .\nI think th it's\nIt's easier than the regular uh remote control .\neasy t\nYeah , and you use these buttons the most ,\nYeah , I think this is easy now . I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to\nhuh ? So\nYeah .\nNo they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find .\nto handle . True .\nYeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls\nI would rate it a\nOh .\nwhere you have to uh find out what  which sign or icon means on uh every button .\nYeah , okay , that's true , that's true .\nYeah .\nSo\nSo you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most\nwhich\nBut that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text .\nSo which number are we going to fill in ?\nYeah .\nI would say yeah .\nI think it's uh it's a two , at least .\nYeah . Yeah ,\nA two , yeah ?\nyou can make it a two .\nTwo , three and\nIt's not perfect , but\nYeah .\nwhat do you think ?\nI think it's a three .\nA three ?\nOkay , so we have two , two , three .\nAnd why is that ?\nI personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy .\nYeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You can touch it .\nYou can touch it .\nYeah . You you can touch options .\nIt said bo both the options .\nYeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button ,\nYeah .\nright ?\nYeah .\nOkay , then okay , good . Then I think also two , yeah .\nYou can touch options\nA two , okay ,\nand it's comes out .\nbecause we have to\nA two , a two .\nYep .\nThe uh the um  Below .\nIt's the box below it ,\nUh the next question the next question .\nhuh ?\nOh my God .\nOtherwise we have two results in one question .\nIt's different .\nOkay , next question .\nIt's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people .\nFor young people I think it's easy to use .\nYoung means sixteen to forty years .\nYeah , I was  uh\nYeah .\nAnd elderly from forty eight to their death .\nYeah .\nI think it's\nI think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured .\nIn the entire mankind .\nOkay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design ,\nAlso if you're sixty years old\nhuh ?\nYeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen .\nYeah .\nSo it's t I think it's really easy to use . You want these options to\nAlso\nAs well for the for the older people ?\nUh sure .\nYeah , as well as your  if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand\nYeah , but uh  Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , right ?\nNo , but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people ,\nSo\nAnd would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?\nYeah , okay ,\nso it it it has to be\nbut so they could  Uh I think it is . If they read a manual .\nBecause that might\nIf you read the manual ,\nYeah , alright .\nPerhaps that is one of the most uh\nalways .\nM maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use .\nBecause it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult .\nUh because a lot of\nYou say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition ,\nChannel one , channel four , yeah .\nthen you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition .\nYeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them .\nYeah . I think it would make it uh\nYeah , I think it does .\nSo\nBecause all the people who can't uh\nI would make it two .\nAlso two ?\nYeah .\nUh a two . Sure , two .\nNot a seven for this  ?\nThree ?\nOh .\nI'd say three .\nI would also say three .\nOkay , so we have three three two two\nOh . You ?\nor\nTwo .\nOh .\nSo what are we going to do ?\nWell  Two and a half .\nOkay , a three , I see . Uh\nThree ? No .\nGive me more .\nAnother question .\nRemotes overwhelmed with buttons .\nNo .\nNo .\nNo .\nNo , that that's that's\nBut um I mean ,\nyeah .\nthat's definitely one .\nTha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one .\nThat's definitely our uh\nOh nee , oh seven is it ? It is .\nNo ?\nYeah , uh\nOh yeah .\nYeah . Yeah ,\nthe remote score .\nA false , yeah .\nbut I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad ,\nYeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed .\nbecause otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results ,\nIt's not overwhelmed . Yeah .\nso\nYeah , indeed .\nTrue .\nOkay , a one ,\nYep .\nbecause we designed for that , huh ?\nRemote control has uh colours that different  that meet different target groups .\nYes .\n'Cause we make them in different colours ,\nYeah .\nso that they uh\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nis optional .\nYeah , and I though w we had about single colours ,\nThat's true .\nbut you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing ,\nYeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah .\nHuh .\ncan't you ?\nAlso with rubber ?\nUh I think you can .\nWhether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood\nYeah , okay .\nbut\nIt it feels like rubber ,\nYou can make a print on rubber ,\nbut\ncan't you ? Yeah .\nYeah .\nSo that's a one then ,\nWell but then when you scratch it it does come off .\nYeah ?\nhuh ?\nThat's a one ?\nSo that's a bit\nYeah , it is it is harder to\nOkay .\nDo you have many questions ?\nUh I have\nto like\nOh , okay well\nOh we have time .\nGeez .\nYeah , but we have  We also  We have to get to the money .\nWe're getting paid . We're getting paid .\nThe material used is spongy ,\nWhat ?\nthat that's uh that's a one , that's m rubber .\nWhat  spongy .\nYeah , yeah , it's very spongy .\nUh .\nYeah ,\nOh\nI th think it's not the most spongy thing .\nbut not  it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . I think it's a three .\nYeah , it's a three ,\nUh-huh , yeah .\nYeah .\nbecause you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible ,\nHard but  Yeah . You can  break it .\nbecause it has a L_C_D_ screen .\nYeah .\nHard to lose ,\nRemote control is hard to lose .\nyeah it sh and it's easy to find .\nY yeah , you could you could call it .\nY you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh  set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it .\nYeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose .\nIt isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally .\nTwo . That it's hard to lose ?\nNo .\nYeah , it it is  there's the\nYeah ,\nIsn't hard to lose .\nso isn't hard to lose you .\nit's a six , you think ?\nIsn't hard to lose , yeah .\nIsn't hard to lose .\nSo it's a two . Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't\nYeah . You can't lose it .\nyou can make it a three I   It does have an  a built in function .\nOr if you're you're sixty years old , your demands\nYeah , but a har A hard to lose is good . So it should  this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it .\nNee . Hard to lose . Oh right .\nYeah , this this is hard to lose .\nIt is hard to lose . Yeah , so then this is  it is almost true ,\nThis\nA two .\nI think  yeah , I think also .\nso a two .\nA two .\nTwo , yeah .\nOkay .\nAnd most all because of the option to  Whoa .\nHuh ?\nOoh .\nYeah , it's okay . That happens above also . But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal ,\nOh .\nUh .\nYeah ? Oh , okay .\nbut  Yep . Oh ,\nNo .\nit isn't ,\nOh well ,\nwell okay .\nit doesn't .\nput the cor cursor  on the  .\nRemember .\nOkay okay okay .\nClick .\nRemote control mainly be sold to younger people .\nI think it will ,\nTrue .\nyeah .\nTrue .\nYeah ? True ? Very true ?\nUh well\nUh yeah . Uh\nThere .\nI  a\nNo , I don't think very true because the colours .\na two .\nWe have the colours . Um we have the buttons is  aren't that that much .\nMaterials , yeah .\nNah , the material isn't that\nIt's it's much more younger .\nUh okay . So ma uh make it make it a two .\nSo I don I think I think it's a three .\nWell I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially ,\nYeah .\nYeah ,\ndidn't we ?\nI think it's a two\nbut I uh\nbut\nOkay , okay .\nWhat do you think ?\nI think because\nQuestions ?\nA two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too , two too too .\nTwo . Uh-huh .\nyeah ?\nTwo two two .  Let's make everything a two .\nIn the features ?\nDissatisfy younger people . Um\nYounger people . It has\nWell perhaps not .\nWhat did\nBecause younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing .\nYeah . Well that  it doesn't .\nWell , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that ,\nYeah bu but\nbut it's for a remote control I think it i  it would satisfy those needs .\nI think they like the speech . You could call to your uh\nYeah , the speech possibility ,\nyeah , and the screen ,\nthe colours .\nL_C_D_ screen and scroll .\nyeah .\nScroll options , yeah .\nI I think they'll be quite met with their expectations .\nYeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something .\nRight , that that that\nNo .\nIt has relatively few features ,\nthose are features .\nIt's three features , basically ,\nwith\nthe L_C_D_  touch screen is feature .\nYeah .\nNo ,\nThe microphone is a feature .\naren't the features  the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature ,\nYeah .\nand that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . Yeah .\nOurs had other features with\nYeah , okay . I think  yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings .\nThe easy volume up button .\nThose are features .\nRemote  younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume .  Turn uh turn up the volume .\nYeah yeah .\nEnough features ?\nSo I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one . Personally , yeah . I think once you've  'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the  you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra .\nOkay , you think one ,\nYeah .\nwhat do you think ?\nI think two or three .\nYou .  three , yeah .\nTwo .\nI'd say three , so two it is then\nYeah . Yeah uh a two a two .  Just another two .\nMake it make it a two .\nor\nOne two three .\nOr make it uh a fucking two .\nWe like two .\nRight .\nYou can see the remote control is  R_ and R_ .\nYeah , there's R_ and R_ in front .\nYeah .\nUh .\nYep .\nHas\nUh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ .\noh yeah , do did have  nah y you have the black one .\nYeah .\nAnd we'll probably make also a yellow one .\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nYeah ,\nbut not R_ and R_ yellow I think .\nmaybe maybe two . Well m th but the logo is on on the front ,\nOkay , true , yeah .\nMaybe two .\nso  a two , yeah ,\nOne d on i it's the colours and the\nX_ marks spot .\nthat's\nAnd the menu is avail that is available is easy to use .\nI think it is , but I don't know what you think .\nI think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained .\nYeah , tha that's so true . Mm-hmm .\nInstead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button .\nMm-hmm . Yeah , uh\nAnd you can navigate easier , because wi with the  you have to push the the the arrows and  with a normal T_V_ uh remote .\nYeah , you can navigate . Uh .\nI think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it .\nYou're not satisfied , okay . Let's start over again then .\nNo , I'm not not convinc .\nYeah .  Let's make a different remote . Well\nLet's go th for  inhalation of air]\nMenu .\nI think it would be a t yeah , two .\nA two ?\nA two .\nNow lower .\nOh , well that's that's pretty good ,\nWe only have twos .\nhuh ?\nOh yeah , I think so . Yeah .\nUh just twos . One three and a few ones .\nAnd three .\nSo okay , we have one three , a one , that that have to got up .\nTwo threes .\nTwo two two two two .\nWe m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good .\nSo two , yeah . The average is a two .\nYeah .\nThe average .\nThat is quite good\nYeah . I think so too .\nYeah , I think so .\nin my opinion . That\nWe can be happy .\nOoh .\nSave .\nYeah .\nOoh .\nWhat is it ? It's like a bug or something .\nIt's a fly .\nA fly , yeah .\nOh m\nA f butterfly .\nTop .\nYeah . That's it .\nOkay .\nThat was your evaluation uh show ,", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "powerpoint, questionnaire, evaluation, design, evaluate", "dialogue_id": 102}, {"text": "Yes .\nokay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results .\nSure .\nNo , it's two . The average is two .\nOkay , good .\nIt's good . Yeah .\nUm let's see  oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already\nYeah . Exactly .\nYeah , I uh uh I uh saved it .\nAnd this  Everything okay . Well , the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it .\nBecause we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that .\nYeah .\nRedesign . No .\nAnd um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder .\nlook on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty ,\nYeah .\nwe're good , and if they're not we're going to uh re-design ,\nYeah .\nbut we have to do that uh very very quick I think ,\nSo we're going to erase features or something .\nyes . Um I don't know if I\nDo you have the cost\nput the Excel sheet in the\nor uh   Let's hope .\nn not in the\nf fifty five Euros .\nfolder . I think it's\nWe're going to be here at eight o'clock .\nI think it's still in my own documents folder .\nWe're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock .\nNo .\nOh shit .\nI doubt it . Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet .\nYeah mm yeah , maybe .\nSo\nNo ,\nThe microphone .\nYeah .\nit was in my uh my information , so uh\nIt i It wasn't too much .\nYeah ?\nYeah .\nmaybe you're going scrap scrap it .\nAs well as the L_C_D_ screen . Whoa .\nOkay , well this is it .\nWell , if it doesn't work\nUm maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes ,\nI want to fill it in , but uh\nand uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions .\nNo prob . Ah .\nBut you should uh direct\nCount it ? Li like write it be\nWell we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . But you have to fill in this column , huh ?\nCount it . You got Excel to count .\nThe number of\nNo , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay\nOh okay .\nand there are different screen shots , so  or different different screens ,\nWell I dra\nAh , okay , cool .\nuh Danny , Danny , I'll do that ,\nHuh ? Yeah ? Oh , yea yeah , you design it . Um\nbecause I draw the uh\nso\nWe've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries .\nYeah .\nYeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ?\nYeah . I would do a battery  we do . Right ?\nSolar cell . No\nWe'll wait .\nA battery . One battery ,\nNo , no solar cell , no no no no .\nit took a battery ?\nright ?\nYeah .\nNo hand dynamo .\nYeah .\nElectronics , simple chip\nHand\nWe have\nadvanced chip , right ?\nNo , we have sample speaker .\nOn advanced chip .\nBut b al but we also have sample speaker , do\nYeah ,\nYeah , yeah .\nso this one and this one . Uh we ha we have um single\nOh , we already on nine .\nwhat ? Are we ? Oh yay .\nWe have double curved .\nThe single .\nSingle nee single curved . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional .\nSingle .\nBut it isn't three dimensional ,\nOh the the\nit isn't curved in a l\nThis one is\nit's not going to work uh people . We have rubber .\nThis one is curved like this ,\nI'll just fill it in .\nright . It's curved like this .\nNo no no ,\nUm rubber indeed ?\nsingle curved is like this . Uh that's the only curve you made ,\nYeah , bu what\nnot th uh curved like that . That's uh\nOh , but we have curves like it and it .\nThirteen ?\nThere are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand .\nWith a scroll wheel ,\nHuh ?\nright ? Is he integrated ?\nYeah .\nRubber .\nNo , eh ? I don't know .\nYeah ,\nPush button . No , we don't have push button .\nwe gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s\nOh yeah , right , we want it to  it's not it's not  no .\nNot going to work ?\nL_C_D_ display .\nYep .\nOkay . Okay um\nFifteen , oh , too bad .  Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ?\nBut now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements .\nOh , we don't have any buttons , so\nEighteen and a half ,\nYeah , we need to uh\ndamn .\nDamn .\nWe have to lower it with six points .\nNo , uh we have fifteen and\nOkay .\nTwelve and half .\noh , right .\nWe could lose the curve .\nNah .\nWe could use\nYeah , I would lose the curve .\nWe could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel .\nBut you can't push it , so you have to tap .\nYeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh  with uh the button .\nYeah , alright .\nYeah , I think that will be our best bet .\nSo normal scroll wheel ?\nNormal scroll wheel .\nAnd I think we should lose the curve .\nI think we should scrap the sample speaker .\nLose\nIt's four pri it four units .\nYeah , but if you  would i it is a new feature , it it's something special .\nOkay , so we don't exactly need the single  We don't need a curve .\nBut w d wha\nNo , the curve doesn't really\n'S possible to lose curve .\nCurved then it will be square .\nNo , then it will  won't uh stand up from the table . Then it would just\nOkay .\nWas that  does that mean to it , single curve ?\nYeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve .\nYeah .\nThe curve is uh in a dimension .\nOkay .\nIf you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves .\nSo  We would lose this one ?\nYeah , okay .\nYeah , but tha that that only is one .\nYeah , we could s yeah , a bit .\nNo , two .\nNo , one .\nSixteen point three .\nOh , okay , indeed .\nSo we don't\nSo we still\nYeah , we also have to\nIs it possible to make\nCould could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ?\nNo , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen .\nNo ? Ma y you just can't do that , or uh\nNo .\nAnd what did you change ? You changed the uh scroll wheel\nWe changed th\nand\nYeah , and the single curved to uncurved .\nSingle curved .\nOh , but it's just one\nFlat . Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think\npoint , so maybe you should should uh\nNo .\nScrap sample speaker ?\nYeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition .\nThe sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points .\nThat that's uh\nYeah , but it's t\nYes , four points .\nAnd then you can keep the curve .\nYeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature ,\nOr can't you ?\nit is something special .\nYeah , uh becau uh when you lose the\nYeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ?\nI don't know .\nF You have to  we have to scrap four points .\nYeah , that's difficult .\nYeah .\nOr make it on a hand dynamo , but  I don't think that will work .\nYeah .\nMa make it with wood instead of rubber ?\nNo , that's  no .\nUh .\nMake it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ?\nWe could make it titanium instead of rubber .\nYou don't make a remote control of  Ah .\nYeah ,\nYeah ,\nit it i\nmm-hmm .\nYeah , it also  uh it also takes one point less .\nYeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed ,\nOh . Oh can I ask something ?\nyes ?\nWhat is special colour ?\nYeah .\nIs that the wood uh wood uh\nI think it is .\nthis , we have to have that one too ?\nIt isn't .\nYeah ,\nWhat ?\nYeah .\nbut it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker .\nYeah . Sample speaker .\nTo knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor .\nTh then we still have too much\nYeah , okay ,\nif we use the uh\nBut m yeah , course ,\nthree . Point three .\nbut\nYeah , we we scrap that one ?\nWhat we'll have .\nHuh ?\nLet's make it thirteen or fourteen .\nSee , a po\nPoint twelve  .\nthree .  We need point three .\nThat's a scroll wheel .\nUh it's a colour . Don't make it wood .\nA colour .\nYeah , but a wood\nMake it uh\nwe can make it brown , dark brown , not wood .\nYeah , but it's it's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ?\nYeah , special colours , fruity colours .\nIt's also green or uh\nIs it also\nYeah .\nno that that's just normal colour  fruit colours .\nYeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour .\nNormal colours , yellow\nYou have to add something to the rubber to make it green .\nYeah .\nYou don't say here's green rubber .\nThey don't sell green rubber plants .\nYeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half .\nAlright .\nYeah , you can , you should  you have to lose\nBut then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh\nNo , it is the scroll wheel , I guess .\nNo no no .\ns advanced chip . No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ?\nIf we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen\nFive ? Then we have two .\nA push ,\nS\nyeah .\ntouch .\nthen it's possible to make . And then you can  and then you can add to the colours .\nThen we can make  add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours  it .\nSpecial c\nSwitch colours .\nOkay , if you lose uh  if you lose the\nIt was such a great idea .\nYou lose this one , you got eleven point five\nThey can add two colours .\nand you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example .\nBut the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or\nHow d uh uh how many colours ?\nWhat do you mean ?\nSpecial colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p\nYeah , but we we we are  we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium .\nYeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour .\nOh .\nAh okay .\nBut I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour ,\nI suppose .\n'cause you have to add it .\nYeah .\nYeah , but the rubbers alls original black .\nYeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote .\nYeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow  uh red , and then you add  you have two special colours on top of the one we have now .\nNee we we also want to make ano another colour .\nOh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u\nYeah , but m\nYeah . We have to make this like four or five or something .\nYeah ,\nThat's what it means .\nbecause we have more colours than only black .\nYeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ?\nYeah .\nI  then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special\nHalf ?\nOh right , yeah . Is it per remote ?\nI think you pay half per remote .\nYeah . Yeah , that's right ,\nSo each remote with a special colour .\nand you  one colour per remote .\nYeah , indeed , yeah .\nSo then it is one .\nYou don't need four of those  uh four of those special colours in one in one remote .\nYeah , okay okay , true . True , true .\nNo .\nI hope .\nWe have two points spare .\nSo the battery ,\nNee one point .\nwe have um advanced chip on print .\nOne . So it would be curved , single curve .\nBecause of  thing\nOr not ?\nYeah , well you can at least make it curved again .\nHmm .\nSo y you just can't make a nice remote .\nYeah , single curve .\nBecause that was very important ,\nIt's too bad for the speaker .\nhuh ? So it's curved , it's still that  so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker .\nShould we change that tha that that's a one if not ,\nMm yep .\nWe dropped the scroll wheel .\nor not ? Could you copy it ?\nAnd the rest is the same ,\nAnd make it uh\nhuh ? Am I right ?\nY yea the scroll wheel is dropped .\nYes .\nThe entire uh\nUh . Huh .\nYep .\nPerhaps you can then copy page or so . Ooh . No . Oh you you made the entire  could you\nOkay . Undo , undo .\nOh\nUndo .\nnot  Well  .\nSo , 'kay .\nWould you ?\nTwenty minutes ?\nBy the  Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page . Select all .\nNo , but you c yeah .\nAlright , something went wrong .\nTap .\nOkay , but this this new remote we can afford .\nIt doesn't work . Let's forget .\nIt should've work .\nOkay , so you had this list at start ?\nHmm ? No , I hadn't .\nAlright . When did you receive this list ?\nI just received it .\nAh okay .\nYeah .  Oh\nThey don't work so hard at the finance department .\nignore that .   Well , so\nAh okay . I suppose this is a\nToo bad .\nOkay , so we lose the scroll wheel ,\nYeah . The microphone .\nthe s\nYeah , and that's it .\nYeah .\nAnd the microphone .\nA and we changed something , I guess , or not ? We  Oh no .\nYep .\nOkay .\nTwelve Euro fifty . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ?\nYeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work .\nIt didn't work .\nSo we could fix it like tha that it's like this .\nHmm . Strange .\nYou could select it all , but then you can't erase .\nStrange .\nOh , you can arrange\nYou can only re erase ?\nErase .\nOh .\nWhen you saw th li uh  Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything .\nUh , no .\nHmm , can't you then just say copy ?\nBling .\nNew page . Paste . Yes .\nAh .\nSelect none .\nJust tap somewhere .\njust up somewhere b uh besides it ,\njust tap somewhere .\nright .\nOkay ,\nYeah .\nand now you can erase .\nI don't think I can , but uh we can try .\nUh , we already try .\nWell it should be possible .\nOh , yeah ,\nOh no .\nno , ha-ha .\nWell you can draw over it with white uh pen .\nNo ?\nYeah , we tried it earlier .\nOh .\nIt's very much work .\nYeah . Sorry .\nWell but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now\nEvaluation drops .\nwhich we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design .

Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ?\nDeadlines were sometimes very short .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nBu but stressful . You think , no , my presentation isn't ready .\nBut\nYeah .\nAnd stressful .\nI think we  it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nNow we worked through each other ,\nAnd you could ask things .\nYeah , you had information I didn't have\nsomething he said\nand then uh\nyeah , and you had information I also had ,\nOh right .\nYeah .\nso some some things I had in my presentation , they already told ,\nYeah .\nAnd for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ?\nYeah .\nso\nAnd uh\nYeah .\nSo yeah , that  I don't think that is the best way to work at  for such project .\nYeah .\nNo .\nSo you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work .\nYeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate .\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nbut but why not work here together , for example ?\nYeah , you could\nWhy should we be separated from each other in those difference  uh different rooms ?\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm-hmm . Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process ,\nI think so too . Yeah , but then you can work together too\nYeah .\nhuh , th  you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks .\nwhen\nYeah m yeah , like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something ,\nNo .\nA chat would also be uh\nHuh , oh right .\nbut now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think that was the best way , but\nBut the technology was uh fantastic .\nWell ,\nYeah , the technology's okay .\nI I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think  .\nWork now ?\nYeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because\nPerhaps it is e\nIt does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh\nYeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh  and lay it next to that keyboard over there .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo you can draw uh  see it over th on the screen .\nYeah , like the f like a plotters or something ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nyeah . Yep yep yep yep yep .\nSo you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful\nBut\nor\nWell\nIt's useful , but not m\nit is useful ,\nYeah , it is useful , but\nbut it doesn't really work all the time .\nNo .\nTh the pen doesn't\nBecause when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below .\nThe line is a bit off .\nYeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also .\nYeah ,\nAlright .\nYep .\nyou can point to where you want the line to be . But\nThe project uh  because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh  have , you didn't have time to uh  to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation .\nYeah .\nSo you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the  Oh .\nThat wasn't me . Uh  so um\nYeah .\nWasn't me .\nthe means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ?\nI   I I used it ,\nI didn't use it at all .\nit it was  you can use it , it's quite handy I think .\nYeah , well\nBut I didn't  I uh\nI use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer ,\nYeah , I used it to y to\nhuh ?\nYeah , it did work pretty well .\nI used it too , but  oh well .\nI don't think why you would want to use it actually ,\nYeah .\nI didn't use .\nYeah ,\nbut it it does work .\nbecause it shou\nNo  yeah .\nYeah .\nTo make some designs ,\nIt is it is\nit is very easy .\nyeah , it is easy for  to design something and then load it in your computer .\nYeah .\nYeah , and then you can show it to everybody .\nBut to write it th yeah .\nYeah .\nIt doesn't really write normally .\nYeah . It's b bi little bit too big to write .\nIt's a bit\nYeah , it's too big , it's too fat .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nFat document , those .\nOkay , um and what about the teamwork ?\nI think it was great ,\nTeam work was okay .\nYeah , well I think so too .\nyeah .\nYeah .\nwe\nOnly thing that we worked through , past each other .\nYeah ,\nRight .\nbut that was  it was our assignment ,\nWith some things that was only problem ,\nYeah , but it was because we didn't uh\nbut\nhuh ?\nYeah .\nYeah yeah yeah ,\nOkay ,\nbut furthermore better .\nand maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership .\nThat's\nI thought it was good , but uh  Yeah .\nYeah .\nyeah , no prob . Ah .\nYeah well , okay .\nYeah .\nNot too much , not too too too too  .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nAnd creativity ? Well , when we look at this I'd say we have been creative ,\nhuh ? But\nWell .\nYeah , or the room for\nThere was room for\nit was the idea to be creative , so\nYeah .\nYou got some standard ideas in your head  and this what came out .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd you get get stuff from the from the computer ,\nYeah .\nbut\nThe information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late\nLittle bit uh lo yeah . Too late\nYeah .\nor\nit it it took a lot of time before you got your ema\nYou just sit there for ten minutes . Yeah ,\nYeah .\nyeah .\nwhere is that email ?\nI played I think seven times Solitaire something .\nYou did ? Well ,\nOh\nI didn't have time for that .\ndid you ? Is it on there ?  Is it on there ?\nWha\nI didn't find the  didn't look but uh\nAt some times I  Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment ,\nWas searching and searching .\nOh right ,\nI didn't look ,\nit is there .\nbut\nand then\nNo , I I never got that .\nI always\nI got like one email after ten minutes or something .\nI even got spam .  Or something like that .\nN yeah .\nThat's what we said .\nSo does this  I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes ,\nAnd it  not a lot uh\nin in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do .\nNo , the first one .\nNo , w I didn't know\nI didn't know uh\nYeah , like I  with with the remote  and I never new we have t we had to uh  yeah made a made a rec a remote control .\nMake a r\nnee .\nyeah .\nAnd I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here ,\nYeah , so\nso I went , right .\nYeah . No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page .\nYeah .\nAnd I was working and working and work\nJust looking at the screen and uh\nNo .\nOkay , well um\nSo , yeah .\nbut after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better .\nYeah .\nWhen we get uh  when we have  we would have gotten uh more information .\nYeah , an\nYeah ,\nMm-hmm . Faster .\nmore information about the costs .\nYeah , that will be handy .\nYeah .\nFirst of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh  first point ,\nYeah .\nbut uh it was possible uh  uh , yeah .\nYeah , it only costs four units . Uh  yeah .\nYeah .\nYea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that .\nYeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process ?\nUh , I dunno .\nUm  Yeah .\nThink that's about it .\nNothing .\nHmm .\nI think we got it already .\nHeavier um  less heavy laptops .\nYeah , they're pretty heavy .\nUh . Faster laptop .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUh . They were they were just fine .\nBut that's not really uh\nAnd furthermore the the the network was okay .\nYeah .\nUh .\nEverything you loaded was also\nYeah , everything worked .\nav available there .\nRight .\nAnd so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work ,\nSo\nis what you say .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah . Yeah , but that  It's now half past four  half past three , so\nYeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone .\nYeah , okay . Yeah , okay .\nThen it pops up  pop up screen came . Five minutes in the meeting .\nMm-hm . Mm .\nNo .\nMm .\nYeah .\nOkay , so more time during the individual work phases . Um okay well uh\nHuh .\nI just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide ,\nYou did ? Well\nyes , which is the closing . Well uh , we managed , but we did it very quickly . I don't know if that's the best way to  when it isn't  is it  when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it ,\nOh , right .\nbut we had to do it ,\nWell\nhuh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . And we evaluated . Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . And I think uh everybody's uh very happy . At least I am , with the results ,\nso uh celebration , well , for the three of you ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nbecause uh I have to write the final report now .\nChampagne .   Yeah .\nBut uh  well , thank you very much for your co-operation ,\nand I had a very nice day so far .\nYeah , sure .\nNo prob .\nOh thank you .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nDo we get another email ?\nBling .  You're fired .\nUm\nI think you do .\nI I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again ,\nYeah I have t\nbut\nI think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but um  well\nWe do ?\nMm .\nI at least . But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report .\nYeah . Uh th that that one ?\nYou cannot\nYeah , maybe .\nYou can just\nyou can save it .\nwants to , but at least this one .\nYeah , but it's  it isn't a picture or , well , is it ?\nI know , we should remove this ,\nYou s uh file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG .\nbut it won't h Okay . And uh please put it in the project folder then , huh .\nCan you find it as a J_ PEG ?\nNo ,\nNo .\nisn't possible .

Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . Uh so we will see our three presentations . Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .\nOkay , can I have the laptop over here , or ?\nYep . Oh , I don't think so . I think you have to come here .\nOkay . Have to get up .\nI dunno . I think it should stay .\nExcuse me .\nYeah , that's it .\nOkay .\nShould stay in the square here .\nOkay .\nOh , maybe .\nOkay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control .\nOh , you can put it here . Oh that's okay , it's jus\nUm so first of all we  what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls .   So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . Um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . Completely ugly . Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most  by far the most used buttons on the remote control . Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ .\nUm the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . And basically they came  they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . Um and the audio and picture settings had a very  that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well .  So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . Um  they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . Um and then thirdly , they  some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury .  We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the  on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control .\nUm basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . They want these features , they want these high technology features .\nUm for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . Whereas um  the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control .\nHmm .\nThat's my dic that's my presentation . Thank you .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "usability, laptop, remote, meeting, room", "dialogue_id": 103}, {"text": "Thank you .\nOkay .\nSo , um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . So uh Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ?\nWell , okay , yeah . Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible .\nNo .\nB you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager .\nAh .\nOkay , so  .\nSorry , I'm  Sorry . Sorry .\nOkay . Okay .\nIf I could go there with this cable .\nYou're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .\nYeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want ,\nso it's\nYeah .\nAnd our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think ,\nYeah .\nso I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .\nAt least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally .\nSh okay .\nIt is true .\nWhere's delete button ? Okay . Oh I'm sorry .\nOkay .\nThat's the wrong one , I think .\nYeah , it's still Bob Morris .\nOh . Presentation three ?\nYeah you should have put yes .\nBecause you cancelled it . Yeah .\nClick on yes .\nOh .\nyeah .\nYep .\nOkay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . Okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . Uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands . And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command . Okay ,  uh about  what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to  for designing a remote control . They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves .\nYou still want me the presentation .\nThere are two different uh uh solutions I mean . This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . And uh also as uh I understood , and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob , uh uh presentation , people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control . And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with  uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . Okay . That was my presentation .\nOkay . I have a question .\nUh-huh .\nDo you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?\nUh , I don't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the  with other devices inside the home .\nOkay .\nSo can we use any any frequency ?\nYeah , it should be okay  .\nWe have the right to use any frequency ?\nUh no but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission .\nOkay . And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same  have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ?\nUh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it\nOkay . A kind of identification  ,\nYeah , identification code inside the\nYeah f  uh I know about this , since it's my  it's exactly my field , so .\nokay . So\nIt's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to  uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote .\nYeah . So\nSo so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay .\nOkay .\nThe password may simply  uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . A specific uh remote control has a specific f\nYeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . It's worth to buy .\nHmm .\nAnd they have these problems solved so . So we don't have to think about these .\nMm .\nOkay .\nOkay .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remote, cable, buttons, interface, devices", "dialogue_id": 103}, {"text": "Mm-hmm .\nSo , maybe you can talk about the function , and\nOkay .\nYes . I have only a couple of things because I had  I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . I was used to use Linux before , so . But I tried to tried to break through this  too , I guess .\nOpen .\nMm . Ah .\nOkay .  How to make it big ?\nSlide show .\nFive .\nSlide show . Okay , thanks .\nIt should work , so you can  .\nOkay . Oh so I will speak about working design . That's the first slide . Uh what uh I have to do ? A look at what the other company  Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication  for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them .\nMm . Yeah .\nSo , you know . Uh , okay findings , that's  the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave  radio frequency circuits are available now ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut the prices I read are high . So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on ,\nMm-hmm .\nHmm .\nbut you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . Uh . Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition ,\nbecause the speech rec Yeah ?\nAre we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ?\nNo no no no no . This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves .\nOkay s So we just buy a circuit board and\nExactly .\nOkay .\nBut I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . This I prefer that we should make ourselves .\nOkay .\nBut it depends whether we take a decision to use it . Same thing . It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . So , speech recognition  well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ ,\nso I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit .\nYeah .\nBut the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the  what does it offer , you know .\nMm .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "circuits, interface, components, circuit, design", "dialogue_id": 103}, {"text": "Yeah . So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ?\nYeah , I'm\nOr it would be maybe feasible ?\nOh . I was not thinking too much about the price . But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards .\nOkay .\nIt depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ ,\nMm .\nI'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not  Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so .\nOkay .\nWe will discuss it afterwards . Oh , this is nothing . This is just my notes on what to use . And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . That's my opinion . Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency .\nWhy ? Because it's simpler ?\nBecause because the the range where you can use it is fair .\nYeah . Mm .\nIt's okay I think . And the price is fairly cheap for this .\nOkay . It's a a price matter .\nWell , depends .\nYeah .\nJus just the price .\nMm .\nOtherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy .\nOkay .\nSo I I I think it's o y o  .\nWhat how much more expensive ? Are we talking three times more expensive ?\nWell , three to three to five .\nOr ten times more expensive ? Or\nN not ten times ,\nOkay .\nbut it depends what what we\nYeah yeah . That's still a lot . I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money ,\nHmm . Yeah .\nbecause I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo it's not worth spending the extra money .\nWell I  , oh\nTh they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know .\nOn the other side , we want to have something new .\nYeah .\nYou know , where\nYeah .\nwe want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . But maybe  .\nBut I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are  prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves .\nOkay .\nSo I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase .\nYou the user interface , and management man , uh\nOkay . Yeah .\nMm .\nOkay .\nUh okay , that's it for me .\nOkay , thank you Peter .\n'Kay .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "electronic, radio, device, backlight, communication", "dialogue_id": 103}, {"text": "So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um\nMm .\nfirst um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . Uh apparently it becomes from  according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . And uh  Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . Um . So I think we can avoid the teletext . Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it  it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the  only specific T_V_ remote control .\nI agree .\nThe third  the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . So um uh we should we should keep uh  The the product should be recognisable . Uh , uh It's  That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of  in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . So , um  So now we we should take the decision what we are going to  what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ? Uh .\nWell , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .\nYeah .\nAnd then we can move on to the more advanced features .\nMm . Yes .\nMaybe , maybe .\nOkay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . Uh radio frequency depends . And , well the recognition it depends on you guys .\nYeah but first maybe what is  what are the usual function of a standard remote control ?\nYou should probably speak .\nI mean\nOkay .\nwhat do\nOkay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nI think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .\nYeah .\nSo , yeah .\nYeah , okay .\nSo , turning channel , of course . Volume setting .\nUh just one note to the chan channel changing . Do we  will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? I mean those nine plus one or two ?\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nI think it would be a b\nBecause it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .\nYeah .\nMm .\nOn the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's\nYeah , I\nYeah .\nOkay so so we keep all these all these buttons .\nMaybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like\nYeah yeah , at least nine , ten button .\nuh\nLike ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something .\nYeah . Maybe something like that .\nOr using the names and the keyboard\nAh yeah .\nUh .\nI dunno .\nOr\nMaybe\nOr something  .\nOh I don't know . Oh . Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and\nYou mean like hierarchical structure .\nAnd inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch .\nMm-hmm . Okay . Like categorising channels .\nIf you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus .\nOkay , so s\nMm-hmm .\nOh sorry .\nI It just an idea .\nOkay .\nI don't know what you think about that but .\nSo it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you\nYeah , probably , yeah , yeah .\nTo have some feedback . Yeah .\nOkay ,\nMm-hmm .\nso I'll make a note on L_C_D_ .\nWe could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nSo we c you could quickly just   through many channels .\nYeah . Like roller for the  Yeah . Okay .\nFor the channels , perhaps .\nAnything else ?\nSo we've got channel and volume . Um .\nYeah .\nSo we are still s speaking about the common devices\nor we are inviting the new one ?\nI think so .\nYeah .\nI think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones .\nWhat about the settings of the T_V_ ? Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's  we need it anyway . So\nSo uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh\nYeah .\nwe should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can\nOn the screen , you mean ?\nYeah . Yeah b\nNot on the control , but on the screen .\nNot on the control , on the screen , on the T_V_ screen .\nWell , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then .\nAnd then\nI don't Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones . I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think .\nYeah , yeah . I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_\nMm-hmm .\nOh . W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWell it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nSo , what are we doing with the settings ? Because settings  if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but\nYeah .\nBut then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time .\nMm .\nTwo T_V_s .\nI mean there's always  we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of  under a slide or some\nYeah . Oh yeah .\nLike ma\nOh , the  .\nWe we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode .\nOr I dunno .\nYeah .\nOr like children and grandfather's mode ,\nYeah .\nand the , well the the user\nMm .\nnot the user , the man mana T_V_ manager mode  . Ah , I dunno .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay . So we have five minutes left . Um .\nYeah .\nUh .\nSo I think s the settings we th we are agreeing  are agreed that they're required .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nIt's just how to a\nWe should hide them somewhere .\nHide them , okay .\nIn the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that .\nYeah . Okay . Yeah . Uh , okay , what else ?\nUm .  Yes .\nI mean a power button's obviously\nThis I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ?\nuh required .\nShould should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally\nIt's it's a kind of setting , I think . It should fit in those settings functions .\nMm . Settings .\nBecause it's not a very current useful function .\nUh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off .\nNo , I think it's after after five minutes or something  a timer\nYes . Well I I uh\nI I think , no ?\nBut if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute\nYou don't need to  every five minutes to keep it alive .\nUh probably . Okay , so we should keep this button .\nYeah .\nI mean based on our usability studies again , um  pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button .\nOh okay , yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nUm , you know , it was nine out of ten\nOkay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff ,\nre relevance .\nwe could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are  you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will\nYeah . Yeah .\nturn off the T_V_ .\nIf if you like this ,\nOkay . B Okay .\nBecause , well   it's maybe question for you t\nI think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nwhich is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off .\nYeah . So s yeah .\nUm and all the other f functionality is\nYeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this .\nnot used very often .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nLike covering cu .\nOn the back , or\nYeah . I mean like the\nYeah , like mobile phone covering .\nYeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button .\nShould we make it a button , or some some something which would be\nFor what ?\nUh power button .\nI think a button .\nA button is better .\nAh oh yeah , yeah .\nI think it should be a bu\nIf it if it's a button or\nYeah .\nYeah a button , yeah I guess so .\nOkay .\nIts own button on the front .\nMm .\nOkay , one nice big button .\nOld fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers .\nHmm .\nOkay .\nSo , any other suggestions or functions ?\nMm .\nS What about things like the clock and um timers ?\nDo we still have the time ? I I just wonder .\nYeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah .\nOkay . Oh . Well what w what was the question ?\nClock or\nUh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display\nUsually it's already on T_V_ or something like that .\nYes .\nYeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote ,\nYeah .\nno ? Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there .\nMm .\nYeah . Yeah . If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?\nMm .\nThis is the question .\nProbably not .\nIs it useful ?\nYes .\nIt's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off .\nW In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want  The simpler it's is better .\n'Kay .\nAh , yeah .\nOkay simple .\nDid you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ ,\nwell  And based on your\nVery , yeah okay , very occasionally .\nBut I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but\nMm .\nYeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote .\nYeah .", "topic_id": 4, "keywords": "teletext, remote, t_v_s, functionality, t_v_", "dialogue_id": 103}, {"text": "Yeah that's okay , that's true . Okay , so no time button  .

Uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure .\nHold on , sorry .  and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time .\nYeah , yeah . Uh actually , sorry I have to see the other  , sorry .\nSorry , uh .\nYeah , thank you .\nUh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? Then\nP press F_ five to start it first .\nSorry . Okay . Yeah , I can , okay .\nHmm .\nJesus .\nUh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . And what we got was , we found that  if you  uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . They are not so good looking . So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available  uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls .\nExcellent .\nThen   And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . So we have to take care of this fact also . Then . Uh it was function I want to go to .\nOh you wanna go back ? Just escape .\nUh , escape , okay thank you . Then if we look at this slide ,\nOkay .\nuh these are in your shared documents , you can see ,\nOkay .\nlike  Uh , sorry .\nSo , sorry  I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? Or is  are you coming on to that ?\nAh t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales .\nOkay . So these percentages are are what ?\nYeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , I can open it in another way .\nOkay . Speech recognition .\nUh , yes . If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .\nSo we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five ,\nHmm .\nand I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group . So we should look\nHmm . We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well .\nYeah . We can look at that that factor also , so yes .\nUh , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of .\nYeah .\nMm , mm .\nSo , and\nAnd then\nFifteen to twe\nYes . I think so . Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market .\nThey find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people  consumers could easily learn . They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls .\nMm-hmm .\nSo this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . So um this is all about\nOkay .\nuh market potential by me .\nMm-hmm .\nUh , yes , th thank you .\nOkay , thank you . Um ,  follow on with Helen ?

Um simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent  fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons ,\nMm-hmm .\nso I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks .\nSales ,  . Okay .\nUm , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um\nYeah it's like a , yeah .  It's  .\nYeah , no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that ,\nRight .\nYeah .\nAnd also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "design, fashion, buttons, fashionable, designer", "dialogue_id": 104}, {"text": "so maybe we forget about that . It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark\nMm-hmm .\nExactly . Yeah .\num which  does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think .\nYeah .\nEasy finder with the a whistle function or something ,\nOkay .\nor rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries .\nYeah .\nAnd I think that , yep , that's it .\nThat's cool .\nSo uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling ,\nOkay ? Mm-hmm .\nand uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? Um , or if\nis that a function we want in the remote ?\nUm , do you have trouble whistling ?\nUm , I haven't been able to\nI don't , but I I know a lot of people do right .\nReally ?\nYeah it just\nOoh .\nI mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ?\nYeah , I suppose that's true .\nMm-hmm , yeah\nWell I suppo uh you could y you could have the\nor some sort of voice\nyou could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ?  .\nThat's costly though .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUm a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know ,\nHmm .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nuh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ?\nSounds good .\nYeah , something .\nOkay .\nWell , uh let me set this up . So I plug it in , press F_ five ? Function F_ five ?\nFunction F_ eight for the um the uh\nOr function F_ eight ? Okay .\nOh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .\nOkay . I think it's  uh just to lock it in . It's got it .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nUm .  So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys ,\num so it's good you went first ,\nAlright .\nand I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .\nLet's remember that .\nUm so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , and uh  he mentioned that they're not fun to use . And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote ,\nthere could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort .\nMm-hmm . But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .\nMm-hmm .\nOh yeah , yeah , that's true .\nMm-hmm .\nWell maybe you could have a um hmm  tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . Um .\nSorry I didn't mean to derail you there .\nYeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um  and not computery ,\nright , so more low tech and not too many buttons .\nMm-hmm .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "whistle, whistling, microphone, beeping, beep", "dialogue_id": 104}, {"text": "So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss .\nRight um , and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window .\nAnd so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before ,\nwhich include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains  Or uh or a high speed train .\nAh is that what that is ?\nRight and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these .\nWell that's cool . If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah .\nRight . So ,\nYeah sure .\nI figured , just put 'em all together .\nYou got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um\nHmm .\nas for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button\nand and it's a  you know , for the the cowboy in all of us\nI I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but\nRight okay .\nWell I like that design .\nYeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a\nIs that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ?\nRight . So I think I I missed the budget thing ,\nYeah .\nit was fifty million Euros ?\nYeah .\nAnd we gotta sell twenty five of them ? Right .  Okay .\nYeah , not a problem .\nFifty million was uh prof\nAh now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g\nAs a profit .\nOh okay , so I I mixed those numbers .\ngotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time .\nOkay . Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less .\nMm-hmm .\nAn energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries\nOkay .\num , we don't wanna have it\nWould it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ?\nUh .\nOr a little base station or something ,  .\nYeah .\nYeah , yeah , we could do that too . Um , I hadn't thought of that . Yeah .\nThat might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's  that's cheaper to just provide batteries .\nYeah , yeah .\nRight .\nI mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it ,\nA battery in it , kinda .\nso I don't think it'd up up the price that much .\nRight , so so\nOkay .\nthe unirs the user interface\nOkay .\nuh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power\nOkay .\nbehind our product .\nUm and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about .\nOkay .\nUm so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me .\nUm as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um  you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that .  And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so  uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .\nMm . Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options .\nYeah , me too .\nOh okay . And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort\nand it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .\nRight .\nMm 'kay .\nYeah .\nThat's all I got .\n'Kay , thank you very much , um I'll take that back .\nOoh that's tight .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "controls, programmable, remote, buttons, shuttle", "dialogue_id": 104}, {"text": "Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is  let's see , I'll find it myself , um   Ta\nOkay , I don't think we need to screw it in .\nnah .\nJust push it .\nYeah .\nWe had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . Um ,  dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind .\nMm-hmm .\nUm it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television ,\nOkay .\nand um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .\nCorporate colour .\nYellow .\nOkay .\nYellow .\nI presume . Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh  I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something .\nYeah .\nUh , where am I ?\nOkay .\nOkay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have .\n'Kay .\nUh ,  now , we had as listed options we had\nspeech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nWe'll use the the basic functions for a television . No teletext . Um  okay hold on .\nAlthough the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap .\nNot enough buttons you mean ?\nYeah .\nSo sorta strike a balance between a a few and a\nWell\nor it looks like we're just cutting on the um\nMm . On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff .\nI do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it .\nMm-hmm , okay . Okay , cool .\nUh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send\nAbout cost .\nsome information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote  teletext option in a remote control .\nOkay .\nOkay um  . So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the  a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick .\nYeah yeah .\nUm so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um  said people didn't like . Although I guess if there's a sort of\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nIf you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever ,\nMm-hmm .\nI think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far\nYeah .\nbut you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um  it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple .\nYeah . Okay .\nUm glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ?\nUm\nUh .\nGlow in the dark material I was thinking .\nOkay . So\nI\nUm , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think .\nUh may I say something about  ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nUh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . But\nOften lost s was that ,\nyeah are lost\nLost , yeah .\nyeah .\nand means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control ,\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nlike if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control ,\nThat's cool .\nMm-hmm ,\nand this will definitely enhance our uh market sales ,\nThat's cool .\nmm-hmm .\nso we should take it into consideration also .\nOkay , cool .\nWell hmm .\nUm speech recognition I take it\nOh it's\nI don't , I've  I know of no products um that use speech recognition well .\nThey're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a  some basic speech recognition on it . You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel .\nReally ?\nYeah , it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one  .\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nYeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing .\nRight , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something ,\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nbut if you can work around that that noise problem\n'Kay .\nUh-huh .\nWell what about\nthis might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or  something\nAh , that's a good idea .\num that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .\nRight .\nSo like a kind of backwards remote from the telly .\nIf you find if y\nRight and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise .\nYeah .\nWhat you could do then would be you have uh  a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s .\nMm . Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah .\nBut yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker\nThat we should just stick on , yeah .\nwhich\nThat comes with our remote control .\nRight , and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap .\nRight , right .\nMm-hmm .\nRight , right . Um .  Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job .\nUh-huh .\nThat could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete .\nYeah .\nWell , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve .\nIt might do us out of a job .\nYeah , okay .\nUm  Okay .  I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . Um so I think rather than  and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that ,\nMm .\nHmm .\nso I th\nAnd the expense .\nyeah and expense and the time .\nMm-hmm .\nSo I think if we're going to go  well I mean like the thing about the  there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen .\nMm .\nUm , but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . Um   uh  and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? Is that\nUm .\nMaybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour .\nMm .\nContrast contra well .\nYeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more .\nYeah , okay .\nMm-hmm .\nSo if it's dow it's d uh yeah . Or if it's down under the couch cushions\nRight .\num which is where I usually find mine .\nMm-hmm .\nRight .\nUm   Okay , well we can use  we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially ,\nYeah ,\num if we're gonna have to\n'cause what I thought , main\nif we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um slogan .\nSlogan , yeah .\nUh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .\nRight . Mm-hmm . 'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nAlright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um  uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .\nThat was more of a a gimmick .\nDo you think ?\nMm .\nUh it makes it fairly unnecessary then .\nYeah , unnecessary . Yeah .\nOkay . Um , okay so scratch that . Uh so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the  is that far too expensive ?\nUm yeah we're getting a lot of features now , I I think\nWell I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself .\nYeah .\nUm\nWell , I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around ,\nMm .\nthere's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged .\nMm-hmm .\nThey're pretty fragile .\nOkay .\nSo is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ?\nUm no , I mean  that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . Um   Uh  So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . Um .  So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um\nYeah mm .\nUh  you were finding out about teletext .\nYeah .\nIf you could find out that uh\nTotally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she  they wi\nUm I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a\nOh .\num expensive ,\nYeah you think so ?\nOh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits .\nno ? Oh right , okay .\nAnd it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system ,\nIs it not the circuits that cost\nlike a\nOh right , okay .\nUh well that kind of takes back the R_F_  the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well .\nOkay .\nUm .  Five minutes . Okay . Decisions . Uh , votes , let's vote . Who wants T_F_T_ ?\nNo-one does .\nExcellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ?\nOkay .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm , that's cool .\nUm , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head ,\nUm\nprogrammability .\nGlow in dark .\nUh\nif it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick .\nUh o okay .\nYeah .\nAnd also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay , so . Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . So , it just helps me summarize them .\nYeah yeah .\nHere ? Sure .\nAnd um I'll put any   I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so uh\nAnd where is it sorry ?\nUh pro uh project documents .\nSo it should be when you save\nOn A_M_I_ scenario controller .\non your desktop , so it goes save as , or\nOh  .\nUh it is in shared documents ?\nAnd then uh hit that little folder up thing again .\nWhere am I ?\nProjoct uh projector .\nAgain .\nProject documents , yeah , it's on your desktop as well .\nAll the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop . Right and then project documents .\nOkay , cool .\nHmm . It is not giving anything .\nShared documents .\nAnd I will tr  getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than\nI was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so\nOkay .\nMm . Did you get my email ? Okay .\nI did  .\nJust making sure .\nOkay .\nSo\nWhat I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . Um , a bit more  durable and that can also be ergonomic\nOkay .\nand it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThe rubber rather than\nMore sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of .\nMm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nWow .\nUm but we have to take care like\nBut we have to take care of our children also if they   means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . So , whatever material we use it should be  yeah .\nOh no , ethics ,  that's gonna cost us money .\nSo  we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care .\nOkay , safety .\nOh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as  it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , um\nYeah .\nI dunno , I mean\nWe could go comp yeah .\nIt sme  smells good for children .\nWe could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball .\nYeah .\nAnd it's got the thing on the inside .\nAnd there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works .\nThat sounds ,\nThat's a good idea .\nAnd then ch children will love it .\nyeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry .\nInteresting .\nOh yellow , yellow ball . Right .\nYeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ?\nPlease God no . Um . Well , I wouldn't th I mean ,\nNo .\nmy reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so I think just having it\nYeah .\nSmall logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow  with the logo in it .\nsurrounding the logo .\nHaving a little bit . Okay cool . Mm mm .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm , okay .\nAnd I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the\nCool .\nwhat was it ? We put  we put fashion into  Whoops , it's not working . Can't believe I've forgotten it  . We put the fashion in electronics .  I bet that'll catch on well .\nOh yeah , that's a good one that . Yeah so .\nOkay , any last\nYeah .\nTwelve thirty .\nworries , queries ? Okay .\nS s\nHmm .\nI know what you're thinking .\nOkay then , lunchtime , yay .\nThat's good .\nOkay , that felt a bit more like a  something with order and and reason to it than the last one .\nThis is quite fun actually .\nWow .\nMm .\nHas anybo oh .\nI really don't\nHas anybody pressed okay , it vibrates . It's pretty cool .\nYeah , yeah .\nYep .\nCheck here .\nWow you've  your first page .\nYeah I've been using up the pages .\nI was just writing really big .\nYeah , got small writing .

Um\n'Kay . You able to look  ?\nIt's gonna have a a plastic body  um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .\nYep .\nThis is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing\nMm-hmm .\num which there'd be sort of a wide choice  they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that .\nOkay .\nUm the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um  it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design\n.\nand uh  the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um  how do you say , it's  yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top\nThe black and white touch screen wherein people can\nMm . So it's flush .\nand the buttons at the bottom would d\nRight .\nso so it'll fully close flat .\nOh right , okay , yeah .\nYeah , yeah .\nAnd working on the inside we've um already said  d decided on the kinetic batteries , which  actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of\nSo put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm-hmm .\n'cause it's the top part that's  okay .\nUm we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in  and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .\nOr something .\nAnd then  yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect .\nOkay .\n'Kay .\nI'm under the sofa .\nAh oka\nOr , that would be too complicated .\nUh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's  be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .\nInfrared  .\nUm it would it would have  obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .  And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the  on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the  we haven't  I don't think we actually put it on .\nLike here .\nYeah , yeah , something like that .\nInfrared could be here also . Yeah , here .\nOkay . Actually , no , it would be  it would have to be on the on the front .\nYeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .\n. So when it's  even if it's open here , the signals would go  .\nOh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing ,\nSo when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .\nyes .\nYeah .\nYeah , that would make sense .\nAnd then finally um on to the interface .  The top screen , as we said , is  would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen\nThis one right here .\nwhich  yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .\n.\nOkay .\nAnd now we've  we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .\nWhich is\nBut not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product\nNo d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing .\nNo .\nonce it's\nLook up to it .\nOkay .\nAnd finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics ,\nThank you very much .\nas that is  that's the company logo  .\nYay .\nWrapping it all up , okay .\nWell done .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "presentation, hinges, prototype, hinge, design", "dialogue_id": 105}, {"text": "Um I've now got evaluation criteria .\nCertainly .\nSo this is the one . Sorry .\nIt's to be presented  .\nThere you go .  .\nLogged in ? Thank you . Oops .\nOkay .\nEvaluation .  .\nMm um I I think this is  chip .\nIt's quite similar to what it was before , though .\nOkay .\nSorry .\nThis stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .  So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those  the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .\nMm-hmm .\nThe design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .  Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up ,\nYeah .\nand I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .\nMm-hmm .\nDoes that seem clear ? Any questions there ?\nAh , it's perfect .\nwe're going to look at these crite So\nIs it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market\nYes ,\nokay .\nwe're going to come to  w we'll discuss each one\nMm-hmm .\nand we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .\nOkay .\nIs that okay ?\n'Kay .\nOne is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ .  This is where I realise how tiny I actually am .\nJust write small .\nCriteria and rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ?\nYeah , so you can\nYeah . That works .\nYeah , okay .\nOkay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nOkay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy  it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . One is true and seven is false .\nI would agree .\nYeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh  two  yeah ,\nI'll just go this way .\nOkay .\n'Kay .\ntwo or three .\nTwo .\nNo , three . Three .\nOkay .\nI would say two .\nTwo .\nI would say four .\nA four , okay .\nMm-hmm .\nAdding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right .\nAlmost three .\nMm yeah .\nTwo and three quarters ?\nI think yeah .\nYeah , yeah .\nOkay . Two point seven five , there we go .  Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three .\nI'd give it a one .\nOkay . Not that you're biased  in that it  the designer .\nNo , no , not at all .\nA two .\nOh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? The first .\nThe average\nYeah , I I just  it the other way .\noh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ?\nUh in  Yep , I just got\nOkay .\nSo , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered  Okay ,\ntwo point f\nand we're just waiting for your rating\nIt's just two point five for that one .\nf\nYeah .\nTwo point five , okay . Losing one decimal place , that's okay .\nOne is a  , seven is false , okay .\nSo what are you rating for this one , Paw ?\nTwo .\nTwo , okay . So that is eight . That brings it down to two ,\nTwo .\nnice and simple , yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .\nTwo .\nTwo .\nI would say a two . I would say a two .\nA two , okay .\nTwo .\nTwo . I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ?\nWe'll just put almost two ,\nOne point seven f five .\nbecause I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places .\nOkay , mm-hmm .\nYeah .\nOkay . Or we  or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at\nD_ .\nit incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .\nOne . Yeah .\nRight . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .\nYeah , that's\nIs this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?\nNo , no , the the base colour was um  white or or like or l sort of a light blue ,\nWhite . With  for the plastic ? Uh blue .\nbut the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any  basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .\nRight .\nAny\nSo we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .\nRight .\nYeah , yeah , yeah\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nand\nAnd the spongy feel is no problem with that .\nYeah , because you'll be having a  Because of the rubber case .\nNo , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that  otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic .\nOkay . In that case it's got to be a one for me .\nYeah , I'll give it a one as well .\nYep .\nOne .\nEverybody ? Okay .\nOne .\nThat part was nice and easy .\nMm .\nYeah .\nOkay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .\nMm .\nI don't think we've really touched on that a lot .\nNo .\nWe've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?\nYeah .\nWell the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_\nIt's meant to be .\nMm-hmm .\nit's meant to . Um\nMm-hmm .\nmaybe because it's slightl\nwith the size that we've got it's quite small ,\nbut with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much .\nMm .\nSo maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .\nMm-hmm . Right .\nIt's quite obvious just big buttons . Um\nRight . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .\nYeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually ,\nA five , okay .\n'cause\nFour .\nFour and a four okay .\nFour .\nTwenty one  is that twenty one ?\nSo that's four point two five .\nYep .\nAnd finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really\nYeah .\nhave the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?\nYeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition ,\nVoice r recognition .\nIt was the I'm here thing ,\nyeah .\nyep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .\nYeah , yeah , that  yeah , that's feasible .\nThat sounds good then . I'd go for a  I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or .\nUm I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand\nA standard .\nit would be quite loud .\nIt would be .\nRight . Okay .\nSo it would be s p\nYou built into the feature .\nAnd if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room .\nyeah .\nOkay . Logical . That's a one for me .\nYeah , one .\nOne\nOne .\nand one , good .\nI do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product ,\nSo ,\nbut\nhow do we feel about this ?\nWe've got our our  we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .  Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?\nI don't think so .\nW I thin yeah , I think\nWe happy to go ahead ?\nI think we  yeah . I think we're set .\nyeah .\nYeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .\nDo much apart from having a huge big\nMm .\nI know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ?\nDon't think so .\nNo .\nGood . Fine then .

Um we've got plastic and rubber ,\na plastic .\nhaven't we ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nPlastic one and maybe rubber point five .\nAnd special colour .\n.\nNo I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing ,\nUm\nwe can put point five .\nYeah .\nDo you think ?\nYeah , I think it allows the point five , yeah . We can use that .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nWhat does it mean if you put point five for that ?\nIt means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .\nIt would be like saying we're using  See , it says case material . So\nMm-hmm .\nwe're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ?\nNo , no , that's  it's as an extra .\nIt's including , it's including .\nRight , okay .\nSo that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get .\nBut it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ?\nThere's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?\nOkay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half .\nOkay .\nOr sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway .\nYeah , okay .\nMm .\nNo , we don't step on anyone's toes .

I don't think so .\nC it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve .\nWe haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though ,\nIs there anything on the menu\nI think\nNo .\nNo .\nRi I think it's in Euro  .\nOkay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um  and the interface .\nIf we tr um . If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?\nAnd going to a regular bat Yeah .\nYeah , the standard , it  um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away  if you took away\nWhat I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery  .\nIf you to\nIt's internal , nobody looks into the battery .\nYeah .\nBut shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi\nAnd people are used to buying batteries ,\nIf if you take away the voice ,\nthey're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control .\nI I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it .\nWhere's that special form ? Mm mm mm .\nShould we see what difference it makes ?\nWhere's the\nYeah i yeah .\nwhere's the voice recognition ?\nNo 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker .\nUm\nRight , okay .\nIf you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .\nWell the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's  that's minus three .\nThey  n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two .\nOh , right . I keep seeing zero . Um   We can do it some other way ,\nwe can do  it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYou could choose to have that or not .\nSure .\nBut they  but I mean in  I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .\nBut we're still working to um head o\nSo should we just change the design specification then ?\nMake it costly .\nWe can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as  this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we  the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .\nYes .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nWe c we could s\nBut we need to work to that specification to start with .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , we could say\nAnd I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers\nOkay , we can make the price fit ,\nYeah , I s\nand then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this ,\nAnd then say we recommend\nMm .\nbecause it also sets it apart from the crowd .\nYeah .\nYeah . 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it .\nThey like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different .\nYeah .\nIt's  s something completely different associated with your company .\nYeah .\nRight , okay , so\nSo if we take voice recognition out\nThat'll do it . Twelve point three five .\nYeah we are close to the budget .\nwe are .\nIs it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?\nTwo five .\nIt's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five .\nAre you sure ? Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there .\nYeah well two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five ,\nRight .  Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ?\nIt's twelve point five maybe , then .\nisn't it ?\nWhich is less than ten P_ .\nI don't know what  it said fifty percent of the cost . So half of the price would be\nI think the agenda one was where the um price was , wasn't it ? No .\nI think it is the first one .\nThat's today's kick off meeting ,  .\nTwelve point five .\nMm .

And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well .\nThank you . How did you find it ?\nYeah , no , I thought it it went really well and I yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good .\nYeah .\nI think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually  if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different ,\nYeah .\nbut  yeah .\nI liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nyou know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field .

Yeah .\nyeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nBut it was nice having it there . Um like the whole picture of the thing .\nYeah ,  moving around the room .  But I think it's good ,\nYeah .\nlike uh we spent times individually . I never thought of a remote control with a flip top .\nYeah , I think it's new ideas in general ,\nIt's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in ,\nrather than\nYeah .\nit so it's  I mean nothing is new ,\nMm .\nbut it's applying it to a d in a different area .\nVegetables .\nThat's mine .\nYeah .\nYeah , no . Well\nYeah , it's\nthey have to come from somewhere , don't they ?\nAbsolutely , yeah .\nThe thing is\nAnd as sh as w sorry ,\nYep , sorry ,\nyou go .\ngo on Sarah .\nUm as was shown by  your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly .\nNo .\nMm-hmm .\nI mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about ,\nMm-hmm .\nbut obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it .\nYeah , I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned . They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , just jazz it up a bit .\nYeah .\nMm .\nUh d they don't really think about it ,\nYeah .\nbecause normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ .\nYeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah .\nBut then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nI mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you ,\nNo .\nYeah .\nI mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray\nYeah .\nyou would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being  a plastic was being made for you .\nYeah .\nBut people could  have anything that they wanted .\nMm .\nSurprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that .\nBecause of the produ Mm .\nAnd new f television products coming up ,\nYeah .\nbut nobody giving uh much idea to this . Like Sarah was telling , everything's\nI think it's really good that this has been very market research based ,\nRight .\nbecause  just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . There are innovations in that that people don't really want .\nYes .\nYeah .\nI see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore\nYeah .\nand it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based .\nMm-hmm .\nWell , it's innovation for money's sake .\nYeah .\nThe the people have to keep buying .\nBut forcing it onto people ,\nYeah .\nyeah . It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want .\nAnd you can't get  you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone ,\nMm . Mm .\nbecause the phones have moved on , things like that .\nOr there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever ,\nYes .\nyeah .\nIt's madness . Um\nSee I think\nIn closing  There we go .\nUm  our costs are below budget with recommendations that they  the budget be increased , but I think  I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?\nWell .\nI think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .\nI think that was just the the physical .\nSo it looks  well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nSo maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at .\nYeah .\nMaybe fifty percent more .\nBut I think  but you were saying that that's quite\nYeah , I think  yeah I don't  from the market research .\nBut I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I think we've done what we were required to do ,\nHmm .\nand I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for .\nYeah .\nNo . Yeah , it was\nI think we've done very well to get within budget\nMm .\nand it still makes such an innovative item\nYeah .\nthat I think people are really gonna want .\nYeah .\nIt's a shame it won't ever get made .\nI know .\nWho knows ?\nMaybe it will .\nMaybe it will .

Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . Okay , here is our project . We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly .

And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright .

I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . They're just such odd creatures , you know . I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess .

So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest  next task , to have  to be done before the next meeting . So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . We also decided to have a wheel to change channel  previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features .

On some web pages to find some documentation\nYeah .\nand I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control .

The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .\nOkay .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not  if if we could combine something with the push button .\nOkay .\nUh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .\nYeah .\nBut is it a significant price on the whole remote control ?\nMm .\nBecause we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control .\nYeah . Yeah\nSo will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?\nI I th  But I don't think that uh we should  We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .\nYeah .\nOkay\nAlso have to say\nBut\nDid you receive the email about the voice recognition ?\nUm that's all\nNo ?\nYou received something\nyeah . I haven't chec\nYeah . You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .\nHmm .\nSays  Yeah . It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . But I guess it could be\nAnd could it be adapted ?\nI guess it's possible . I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command .\nOkay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?\nYeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip\nOkay . Yeah .\nthen we we could use it .\nOkay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on  according to those news .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .\nYeah but I think it's yeah  Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . Um  the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button ,\nOkay .\nand if we could reduce that . We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .\nMm-hmm . I have a question about that actually  . Um , what is the purpose of the light ?\nJust to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber\nIs\nYou can easily find the button in the dark or so ?\nBut  But in th in the dark uh  Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ?\nIt will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ?\nBut if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it .\nHmm .\nYou can see the buttons better , of course .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . True .\nYeah . Actually .\nBut if you move it then you have to have some sensor to  when you move it to detect your movement .\nAs soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .\nYeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ?\nYeah . Again .\nYeah  no it's too expensive .\nI don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be\nOkay . Mm . Extra . Yeah , okay . Mm . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so ,\nFirst of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light\nyeah .\nand you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device\nMm . Mm-hmm .\nBut it can be uh battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ?\nYeah , a little bit . A little bit .\nMm .\nWell we will discuss that after maybe\nYeah .\nOkay\nthe other presentations .\n. So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder .\nYeah .\nSo . It was last time I saw it .\nAnd it is .\nOkay . So ,\nOkay .\njust move to the next slide .  So basically  want very simple , right ? That's the major idea , as simple as possible .\nYeah . Yeah .\nSo I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "remote, euros, wheel, buttons, sensor", "dialogue_id": 107}, {"text": "Yeah .\nUm .  So .\nAnd also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage .\nYeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .\nYeah  . Yeah .\nYeah .\nSo , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nand on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ?\nYeah .\nThese are the basic thing .\nSo it's only the central part .\nSo basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .\nYeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .\nYeah , if you have , for example   I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .\nYeah .\nIt could be on the right side , for example .\nOkay .\nYeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because\nOkay .\nyou open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things .\nOkay . S\nUh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .\nOkay . Will be down or\nSo that they're separate a bit ,\nOkay .\nyeah . Uh and it's easy to press the other  the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .\nOkay .\nAlright , you won't  yeah . Usually what  I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that .\nOkay .\nYeah . That you want to protect a bit . And I think it's uh it's reasonable .\nOkay .\nSo , I don't think  Yeah , this is just the the wheel .\nMm .\nWe could use the  some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .\nMm-hmm .\nUh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .\nYeah . Maybe the wheel will be a  good advantage over our competitors .\nMm-hmm .\nBecause otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect .\nTo s Mm-hmm .\nYeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that .\nOkay .

So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel .

So , are things we are we have uh speak about before .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nYeah . And um  so you you can go\nYeah .\nafter .

Me too .\nIt's robust , yeah .\nHey that's a cool one . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off .\nWhen it d uh takes a shock .\nYeah\nNot good .\nuh sorry ?\nAh it's okay .

I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has .\nYeah .\nYeah that's why\nHas it ?\nYeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .\nYeah . I think it's  it makes it both easy and both innos innovative .\nMm-hmm .\nInnovative . Mm .\nSo I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept .\nHow do we make it look cool is the question .\nCool , fancy ?\nYeah .\nWe have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable .\nYeah .\nMaybe uh um  a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .\nWhat about um\nMm . Oh , colour , yeah .\nWell the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .\nOh  i i\nMaybe yeah .\nI thought about a a pear , for example . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand\nYeah , and it's ergonomic as well .\nand uh  Yeah .\nA pear .\nThe banana is also ergonomic .\nYeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that .\nOr a fruit like that . I dunno .\nYeah . We can discuss that uh . D D Is is there anything you want to add ?\nIs there any fruit that is spongy ?\nI don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told .\nYeah .\nSomething like that .\nAnd for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ?\nBut that's not in the trend .  .\nYou can make it um\nThe trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits .\nYeah . Yeah .\nIt's not hard , the metal .\nI think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .\nYeah .\nPlastic .\nYep .\nSo , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher ,\nYeah .\nand we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ?\nMm .\nOdi\nBanana I think , it's a nice idea .\nBanana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .\nBecause  But\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYou y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that ,\nTwo of the button , yeah .\nbut when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nand here you have a a push button to\nBut you don't have\nI think it's a good idea , yeah .\nYeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool ,\nYeah .\nno ?\nI think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . Maybe we can keep the banana . And it will be very easy to find .\nAnd everybody knows what is a banana .\nYou can put also vibrator inside .\nBasically .\nYeah .\nIf you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha\nAh-ha .

Uh what do you mean by case ?\nI think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .\nYeah .

Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure .\nYeah yeah .

So , it's going to be bend a lot .\nBut\nOh no I think it's possible .\nSo if we try to push the buttons , it\nNo the button would be\nYou think it's possible ?\nIn fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover .\nYeah . Yeah\nOkay .\n. This is uh like the\nYeah .\nOkay odd shape with spongy  cover . And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . So we agree to put the wheel\nMm-hmm .  Wheel on the top . Button , where do we want some buttons ?\nWell , usually hold   'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ?\nYeah .\nSo it have to  it has to be symmetrical .\nUh   Yeah but okay . Sa let's say that th o  It has to be  basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb .\nYep .\nYep .\nBasically . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel .\nYeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable .\nThis for the wheel and then this for the buttons ?\nYeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm .\nShould have the two sides .\nMm-hmm .\nSo if  the left , we have  the op\nI think you can turn it this way also . You can do both with both hands .\nWheel  Wheel buttons .\nI think it's okay .\nYeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . So you cannot see them .\nWell , you you will get used to it .\nYeah .\nAnd moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons .\nSo the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be  Y Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .\nYeah . No you you  I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well . I think this doesn't change that much .\nOkay .\nYeah ?\nOkay . Maybe . Yeah .\nSo , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side .

Okay .\nE_ R_ .\nWhat's your name ?\nUh Martijn .\nYeah , but your surname .  Your surname .\nWhat ? Uh Abbing . A_ B_ B_ I_ N_ G_ .\nOkay , thanks .\nUh .\nI was a little short on time ,\nYeah , me too , so that's not\nbut\nYeah , same here .\nNo no no , I just fi first my\nOh .  Sorry .\nUh let's see . Which one was mine ?\nSo let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough .  Okay , perfect . So we have  Oh no , what's that ? So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are ,\nGood .\nthat we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like  look like . Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting , so I showed uh show them to you . Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one . How do I escape this ? How do I I escape this s uh presentation ?\nWhat ?\nUh left .\nUh\nAh okay .\nSo\nJust  Yeah .\nAnd show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um  Should be a univ uh universal remote control  No , that's  I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . So have you changed that part ?\nOkay .\nOkay .\nUm so  yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um  All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .\nYeah , okay .\nUh so  So  yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh\nWhich one first ?\nOkay .\nOh it doesn't matter , just start with the\nOkay .\nMm . Uh\nFunctional requirements , yeah\nOkay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .\nI I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me ,\nYou didn't read it ?\nI didn't get it uh anyway .\nNo , I didn don't thing we got it .\nIt's only for you .\nOh okay , I I was the only one who get it .\nYeah .\nYes .\nOkay it was uh uh uh um um  a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the  uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements .\nThe last point is quite an interesting\nYes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .\nSo\nUm Martijn alr already said it .\nif we  Yeah .\nAnd uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but  I don't think it's uh\nYeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,\nreachable .\nthen you're you're\nYeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .\nYeah .\nThat that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you  clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly .\nUh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .\nOkay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the  thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't  We we haven't  Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page .\nUh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money .  But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things .\nSo we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .\nBut y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?\nPeople . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,\nI I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,\nYeah .\nbecause  Yeah .\nbecause it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .\nIt's too  Okay .\nYeah .\nUm then  I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's  not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I   If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise .\nBecause it's too expensive . Yeah , probably .\nYeah , only only for television uh  On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .\nYeah , but good usability , so you can use it .\nOkay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a  a new product . We have to be um  Yeah . One of a kind , I think .\nSo it has to look uh uh uh unique ,\nUnique .\nThe company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .\nbut  Yeah .\nYeah , I reckon\nBut old people are not looking for that .\nUh I think mm\nNot really .\nUh\nYeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product .\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nOkay . Yeah .\nto k to keep it simple when you\nBut uh we also have to stand out ,\nYeah .\nSorry I thought about it , yes .\n'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape ,\nYeah . Okay .\nso\nOkay , this was uh my presentation .\nThanks .\nOkay .\nI don't\nSo\nYeah .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "surname, names, paul, w_i_e_s_, wiezer", "dialogue_id": 108}, {"text": "Paul , you can do the next one if you want .\nYou can ask some questions or something .\nOkay . Yeah well  Uh .\nIt's on the on the uh net net uh thing ,\nThere it is .\nisn't it ?\nOkay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't  that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .\nSo what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or\nYeah , I have it on the next page .\nOkay .\nBut yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control\nYeah .\nto find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to  . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh  Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number .\nOkay .\nBut if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your\nYeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ?\nMaybe i maybe it's too complicated ,\nNo y\nbut not sure  .\nWell\nIt's a good idea , but\nit's  It was just a thought . So I'm , I u  I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .\nYeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?\nWell uh\nUh\nwhat I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six .\nYeah ?\nSo uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the\nYeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .\nWell if you said a favourite\nYeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and\nUh mayb for me it's\nWell i\nIf I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never .\nNever ? Oh .\nNo , neither do I .\nSo\nOh are you ?\nAnd\nOkay now , m maybe not .\nIf I don't do it , maybe old people\nNo , maybe elderly people uh . Right .\nYeah , I dunno .\nThey don't like new features . So maybe not .\nMm-hmm .\nUm well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable\nIt's not , it's still not  It's not anymore n uh\nwhen  Not anymore for T_V_ .\nRight , on off .  I dunno , miss  Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ .\nUm\nJust on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need .\nIs\nUh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , but next channel ?\nJust the channel um uh  What I mean is uh\nI don't thi\nForward .\nLi like a web browser ,\nSix seven eight or five .\nso  Oh , okay .\nJust very simple .\nBut uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . Like a web browser back button .\nUm I dunno .\nUh  Yeah ,\nI don't have  Uh I did\nI know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people .\nYeah ,\nNo . Uh\nI don't think you use that . Y only when you want to go to\nYeah , okay .\nYeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .\nAnd how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ?\nYeah .\nNormally you can press one , zero or\nYeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh\nA ten plus or\nYeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .\nOkay .\nTo just keep it simple and standard uh features .\nYeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh  Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people\nUh yeah mayb\nIt gets some seconds .\nBut I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes .\nOh okay . Yeah .\nYeah , it's it's no it's not a\nSo you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .\nYeah , but that's th mm\nIt's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .\nOkay .\nSo if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .\nYeah .\nSo we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that  And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and\nYeah . Yeah .\nBut do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f\nIt's only for television now .\nSo I I don't think so .\nNo .\nUh I just thought of another one .\nNo .\nMost things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .\nYeah .\nSo you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh  But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,\nYeah .\nso you have\nI I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .\nfour arrows .\nBecause you n almost never use menu button .\nYeah , okay ,\nSo\nbut um\nMaybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to\nYeah , a mute button . Yes .\nMaybe , not\nDon't think so .\nI don't know where where you have to put it .\nYeah well ,\nthat's that's  I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use .\nOkay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right .\nAnd later we can d uh do the design .\nOkay .\nOkay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic  Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls .\nYeah . Does it have to be  Uh it has to be uh with different colours\nUm  I dunno . Different colours um\nor\nMaybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow\nIt's like a iMac or something .\nor\nJust to make it\nMm-hmm .\nYeah . Well why not ? Or  Yeah .\nThat's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .\nBut it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it\nWell , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .\nOh , you just  I dunno what happened .\nOh .\nWho ?\nYeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . Just\nThey they're uh designed very well .\nYeah .\nAnd well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .\nYeah .\nBut uh well , I think that's a good example .\nOkay ,\nOkay .\nwe hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it .\nOkay , sorry .\nIs it fin Are you finished ?\nWell uh\nOkay .\nYeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "buttons, controls, button, pages, net", "dialogue_id": 108}, {"text": "Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um  Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh  Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh  And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe .\nMm-hmm .\nBecause infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things\nSo we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?\nbut  Yeah . I I think so .\nUh j Is\nI I'm not sure if it's the same thing .\nYeah , it's  I think it's usable .\nAin't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?\nYeah , that's active .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOr just a green one ,\nSo\nbecause it's  If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .\nYeah . Maybe uh\nI I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh\nYeah , that's right .\nYeah , when you press it .\nBut if you\nSo\nI it's it's just uh the the\nRed's l shows up like something's wrong ,\nTwo ?\nand green is like it's okay , you press the button .\nMm .\nYeah , I dunno .\nMaybe depends on uh\nMa on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red .\nYeah , I know .\nYes .\nSo\nYeah .\nOkay , we make it red .\nBut maybe\nSo\nWell\nI know .\nwe don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well .\nYou have to  The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool .\nI I think uh the batteries will be uh  a little\nUh   Oh ,\nEmpty .\nmaybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh\nNo , we have a recharger in it , so\nOh .\nYeah , okay .\nIf we can still make that then\nUh maybe .\nYeah , but it doesn't have to be red .\nIt's just to indicate something's on .\nYeah .\nYeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low .\nBut it's cool if it was green .\nYeah . It's it's not very important ,\nGreen or red or whatever , it is cool .\nso yeah .\nYeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working .\nSo mm\nAnd uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the  Otherwise it won't work .\nSo we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh\nNo . I I uh  The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to\nOkay .\nYeah .\nAn automatically search function for each television , or something .\nThat are working . Yeah , or  I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there .\nWell , I I use a universal uh remote control ,\nUh I kno\nand  list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ .\nYeah ? Okay .\nOh , I have a modern one .\nAnd the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it ,\nAh okay .\nand then it's okay . So you don't have to search for your television or your code .\nOkay .\nIt uh search uh the pattern for itself .\nOkay ,\nOkay , yeah .\nso we use that .\nSo it uh  We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to\nYes .\nYep .\nYeah .\nI just say  Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking  There's just a short\nUh okay . Well uh y you have this chip .\nYeah .\nThat's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .\nMm-hmm .\nBut uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .\nYeah .\nAnd uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time .\nChanging the signal .\nAnd um  What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so  And then he saves that setting\nOkay . Yeah .\nand then um it's working .\nYeah , that's the right uh option .\nOkay . Well uh the components .\nYeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't  I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .\nYeah .\nUm that's connecting to all the components .\nBecause it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .\nOkay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .\nYeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too .\nBut this one is producing infrared light\nYeah , okay .\nthat's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .\nSo we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . To flash up your\nYeah\nUh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .\nYeah .\nYeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can  Basically if the battery is low , it won't work .\nYeah . Yeah , and\nMaybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button .\nHuh , that's a good idea .\nMm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .\nYeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal .\nNo , y Yeah .\nOkay .\nAnd it's  you also know which button you p\nBut then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .\nYeah , that's right . But it\nEverywhere in the r\nBut does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED .\nNo I don't think so , but  Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else .\nThat looks different , yeah .\nYeah .\nHmm .\n'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is\nIs LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?\nYeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .\nYeah , okay .\nYeah , but mm like when you push it\nYeah , then then won't  Then you won't see it .\nn n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see\nIt must be around it then .\nYeah . Or or m maybe on top of the  A green light is flashing\nYeah , then\nor\nYeah . Not not not not here , but here .\nYeah . There . Yeah .\nMaybe uh\nThe same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?\nYeah , we're thinking about it .\nIf you push\nUh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh\nIt lights up . Everything lights up . That's a good idea .\neverything lights up . Why ain't that on a remote control ?\nYeah .\nIt it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .\nYeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's\nOkay .\nIt's f Yeah .\nYeah .\nMaybe that's a good idea for old people as well .\nYeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote .\nMm-hmm .\nIt's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED .\nYeah .\nNo , I dunno . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use\nYeah ,\nYeah , that's a good idea , okay .\nI uh\nYeah . We'll have enough power\nEverything agre\nto\nEveryone agrees with that , or  Okay .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYep .\nMaybe what Paul said , uh under the  on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .\nYeah , and then you  Okay , yeah . But you have to make a sound device in it then .\nAnd also it's\nYeah , there must be sound in it .\nBut\nHmm .\nYeah .\nOkay , it shouldn't take much\nI dunno .\nYeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be\nMm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .\nUh I th\nYeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .\nBec Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special .\nYeah , okay .\nI think uh you also have uh  remote controls with a lot of options .\nSo\nBut we lose about ninety percent of those options . So I think you can uh\nUh . We have to give our customers some extras .\nYeah . I think we will save money with that .\nYeah , okay .\nOkay . Are you almost finished or just\nYeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out .\nOkay . Okay .\nBecause I was short on time .\nNo worry .\nBut um  Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .\nYeah , I just want to talk some  about some more . So maybe you have to  Yeah ?\nYeah ?\nOkay .\nOkay .\nSo this  Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ? So uh  Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um  Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so ,\nNo ,\nbut\nand I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .\nNo .\nYeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is\nYeah .\nUh .\nWe definitely should use it . Um\nHmm .\nYeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting .\nOkay .\nOh . Mm .\nOkay , that's  It changes things .\nI'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well .\nSo does it make some decision about that ?\nChanges .\nYeah .\nUm\nThat kinda changes the whole situation .\nUh\nWell yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,\nThat still stays .\nto make it more like a mobile phone . More modern .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThat's important I think and\nL_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .\nAnd I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it .\nOh .\nYeah .\nSo\nMm ah  I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you\nOh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay .  No , it's not\nYeah , I tho I think that's not usable .\nNo .\nSo , but uh  Yeah . What other features can we put in ?\nYeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the  Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .\nBut uh some of you had uh something to read about um  uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ?\nI didn't read\nThat's very  That's fancy . That's cool .\nIt's very fashion .\nI didn't read any\nTwelve and you've got twelve .\nb Yeah . Yeah okay .\nMm .\nI I know .\nOnly the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something .\nMm .\nThat should be cool .\nYeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . But\nIf it's possible ,\nYeah ,\nI don't think it's very expensive actually .\nI don't know .\nI dunno . I didn't read it .\nMm .\nWhy should it ?\nYeah , I think it's\nUh if i if i\nYou only have a microphone in it .\nYeah .\nI didn't have information about that .\nBut it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or\nNah , maybe\nAh that's a problem , but\nAnd and uh w Yeah ?\nUh only in English . Only in English I think .\nWhat  But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh  Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever\nYeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but\nuh one to have in channel one ?\nNo , that  Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do  do we do it ?\nYeah ,\nIt's more if we if we do it .\nI dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at .\nAnd and do you have to speak in in like in a thing\nYeah .\nor\nMaybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .\nIs\nIt  We have short time to to put it on the market ,\nYeah , I dunno .\nso that  We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .\nMm  Yeah well\nOkay .\nYeah , I think so .\nWe make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy .\nYeah , and uh and uh\nIt's\nIn uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages .\nYeah .\nI d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .\nAnd and\nYeah . I think so .\nYeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh\nYeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one .\nthe remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay .\nYeah ,\nYeah . Well yeah ,\nit's not uh\nthat's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one ,\nBut  Hmm yeah , T_V_ one .\nbut\nOkay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition .\nWell I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough .\nYeah .\nSo\nMm-hmm .\nwe have to make some decisions . So\nOkay , no speech recognition .\nyou can see on the uh  So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do\nYeah , I think so .\nIf you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?\nYeah , that's good .\nOkay , we just take that one .\nYep .\nAnd what else , we have\nAlso the one in the dark . So uh  It lights up when it's dark ?\nYeah , but it's  Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same .\nI didn't\nIf you push something , it it all lights up .\nOkay .\nYeah . Yeah yeah ,\nYeah , but um\nit it mustn't work all the time .\nYes , that's what I mean .\nIt uh uh it have to work only when you use it .\nOr you can switch it on or something .\nSo if you\nOr maybe when you\nNo , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .\nyeah . It lights up all .\nYeah , that's right . You have to  Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .\nOkay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah .\nAnd do we use a a  Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac ,  if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control .\nMaybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod .\nMm , maybe it's a good idea .\nDifferent colours , uh maybe use even different fonts .\nYeah .\nLike uh phones .\nOh yeah .\nDifferent colours . Okay ,\nHmm .\nso y you just make it th through  You look through it ?\nA see-through . Mm , that's cool .\nYeah . Uh as an option maybe .\nOkay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,\nIt's the standard\nand probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .\nYeah , uh  Yeah ,\nBut you have  You had a lot of different buttons .\nwe but we don't  We don't really have any complicated buttons .\nHmm .\nYeah , maybe you have you have to  Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .\nYeah okay , but  Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little\nO but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it .\nNo , I don't need don't need  Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .\nYeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext .\nYeah , that's right .\nI use teletext as well .\nSo uh\nNo , I use te teletext every day , I think .\nHmm . Okay .\nYeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay .\nYeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,\nMm .\nI think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .\nYeah .\nYeah .\n'Cause  simple buttons .\nOkay .\nIf you put one above it , it's clear .\nOkay . So that's it for toda for  We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um\nHow long is lunch break ?\nSo yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it . You get your meal and everything , so\nTrendwatching . Okay . That's fine .\nYeah .\nYo .\nSo , we're finished for t for this time .

Good afternoon again .\nSo we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of  detail design of the product of the remote control . Um  So here is the agenda for today . Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . And we'll have um  presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro .  Okay . So let's go . Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting .  So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions . No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . We went through the use of wheels and but buttons .  And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . Okay . Um . Good . So guys let  this uh wonderful thing .\nOkay so we can go to the slides .\nOh yeah . Sorry . Um .\nYeah . Number three . Oh number two sorry .\nWhich is\nSo final design . Final design . Okay so Michael you can go ahead .\nYeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow  well to make a banana\nYeah can you show it to the the camera maybe .\nremote  okay so we actually have a\nYou can pull it out first , maybe .\nWe've  well first first of all we made a an attractive  base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh\nMm-hmm .\nbana sit  the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself , it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . We've got the two uh  uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath  we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally .\nWhat's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?\nThis is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh  through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you  quickly rather th\nAh yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops .\nYeah . Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . But normally with uh  it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture .\nUh\nUh-huh .\nAnd we we do have one more functionality . If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ .\nThe T_V_ yeah .\nWhich one ?\nThe s the turbo button .\nThe turbo button .\nOkay .\nSo rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button .\nAdditional button .\nWhat this button for ?\nThis is a teletext button . So once you press that then you get teletext\nOkay .\nand you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh\nTo navigate it through th through teletext .\nTo navigate yeah .\nBut if you want to go to page seven hundred ?\nThat's right , that's right .\nYeah .\nwith the wheel it's easy .\nHow man\nWell then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing , you press the  the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go  you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh\nI don't understand it . Can you repeat it ?\nWell you can you can press press the teletext button\nand then you then you can you can f\nSo then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing .\nYeah .\nAnd you can tele\nAh okay okay . Okay . Okay okay .\nyeah ,\nMm uh\nonce you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .\nOkay . I see . I see . Okay . Okay .\nYeah .\nAnd this is the uh the infrared uh port .\nThat's right .\nAlso the top of the banana .\nExcellent .\nSo . And then we have\nYeah .\nin the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana .\nCalling . Excellent .\nYeah .\nAnd the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?\nActually they do .\nOh .\nThat's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object .\nYeah . So it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage .\nIt's like antennas .\nYeah . So .\nBut yeah that's um that's just like  that's an attractive um base station .\nGreat .\nSo .\nSo , what else ?\nOkay .\nAnd for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries .\nIs it really weight ? Is it light or\nIt is very light .\nYeah , they're light .\nIt's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nYou know , to give you the correct look and feel .\nYeah .\nOk\nAnd we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana .\nOtherwise it's you know a child comes and so\nOkay . Yeah yeah yeah , I see . I under I understand .\nI think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should\nYeah .\nconsider that .  maybe health and safety aspects .\nAh yeah .\nMm-hmm .\nOh we didn't think of that yet . Yeah .\nYeah .\nSo for the power source , apparently you still  you you want to use both solar cells and batteries .\nOh yeah that's right .\nUh you mean  okay . So\nI don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .\nYeah , where are going to  where are you are you going to place them ?\nMm-hmm mm-hmm . It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there .\nIf I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit\nYou have enough surface ? You\nbut yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .\nYeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries\nOkay .\nMm .\nso that that is  .\nWhat will be the autonomy ? Roughly ?\nThe what sorry ?\nThe autonomy . Autonomy .\nWhat do you mean ?\nUh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?\nHow long the  how long the bit the batteries long .\nAh . Ah . A long time .\nYeah . A long\nNo no no ,\nEight to ten eight to ten hours .\nit can  it should be weeks .\nN most  no most of the time it's not being used .\nYeah , so it's\nYeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so\nSo when when you are making it on\nIt's used only when you\nMm . Mm-hmm . No eight or eight or ten hours of working .\nAh , okay .\nIf you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer .\nOkay .\nYeah . F weeks .\nYeah .\nYeah . That's right .\nRight . Next slide ?\nYeah . And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . Pricing is  was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . And uh that's it .\nOkay .  Okay . Those really sounds very good .\nThat's right .\nNothing else to add ?\nIt seems to be falling over .\nI l yeah .\nYeah .\nI like I like it . Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the  the multifunctional buttons . Looks a bit\nYou want to have more functional buttons ?\nLooks a bit puzzled uh I dunno how to say  that .\nYou are not convinced .\nYou  the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not\nNot not many , we we want to keep it simple . So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .\nAnd the volume button will will become\nIt's up to you , means .\nWell in fact b both will be  could be useful , navigating through teletext .\nNow that  Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .\nOr can move between positions in the in the number .\nThat's right .\nYeah .\nAnd what about people who want to use digits ? Butto real buttons ?\nWow .\nYeah . So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .\nSo we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more . And anyway\nOkay . Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ?\nIt's all automatic .\nIt's all automatic .\nYep .\nOkay .  Okay yeah it's fine .\nVery good uh yeah\nW we are living in a wonderful world .\nyou th yeah .\nUh .\nBananas everywhere .\nOkay , so\nAutomatically configure  .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "remote, prototype, evaluation, meeting, functionality", "dialogue_id": 109}, {"text": "So we have to go through now evaluations .\nEvalua yeah .\nYeah .\nSo your slides are ready ?\nS\nUh you're four I think .\nYeah .\nSo this is one , which one is this one ?\nYeah .\nOkay .

And each criteria is  will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it's true or is  or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .\nWhy this strange factor of seven ?\nBecause i I'm sorry .

Yeah yeah .\nOkay .\nGo ahead .\nAnd that's the criteria I I found more useful . I think I sh I  I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?\nMm-hmm . Sure .\nAnd we all four could range\nOkay . Yeah yeah . Yeah .\ncould evaluate the\nOkay .\nSo you can say fancy , handy . Handy .\nOkay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or\nYeah , it's fancy , according to me .\nSeven but\nYeah , six .\nS seven .\nSeven . Seven by me .\nSix .\nI would say seven .\nOkay .\nIt's quite fancy .\nSo you can add seven plus six plus seven plus\nNo , wait .\nYeah uh five .\nWhat do you say seven ? Five ?\nFive .\nFive , maybe maybe maybe six it's it's I guess it's\nOkay , six point five .\nyeah .\nHandy ?\nAgain I'll give seven .\nSeven .\nI'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels\nSix .\nYep .\nbut maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote .\nSo seven , seven ,\nSeven for me .\nsix ,\nYeah .\nSix .\nsix point five . Functional .\nI'll give five .\nFour .\nI would say\nWell it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ?\nEverything ar\nUh for a remote control , does he have all the\nYou know .\nMm everything\nYeah . Yeah .\nyou could expect .\nIt's compared to the all\nThat's right .\nremote controls .\nThat's before\nThat's right . The standards . What is available in the market off the shelf .\nYeah . I have to say four .\nActually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro\nWell it's not a universal remote . Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s .\nWe\nAh it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s ?\nYeah .\nWell all T_V_s but only T_  only T_V_s I guess .\nSo it's universal but for T_V_s .  So s uh four ?\nYeah .\nFive .\nFive ?\nFour .\nFour .\nFour . Four .\nSo four point two ?\nJust four .\nFour .\nfour .\nObviously there are some outliers so\nSo four ?\nOkay cool ? Cool device .\nThere I'll give it seven .\nIt means cool features , like new features actually .\nThat's right .\nWhich\nFor a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature . And then the scroll buttons are again cool features . We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have .\nYeah . Seven .\nI would say five .\nI'll say five .\nSix .\nMm-hmm . Seven .\nPlus six , I say  I said seven .\nYeah .\nSo it's six .\nS yeah .\nYou said seven ?\nYeah .\n'Cause it's five five seven seven so\nOkay .\nUh , okay , definitely easy to use .\nDefinitely seven .\nSeven .\nSeven . Seven . And you ? Outl you are not lik outlier .\nFive .\nSeven\nOkay okay okay okay .\nOkay .\nSorry , I have them\nAlright , now here's the sixty million Dollar question ,\nwell , twenty five twenty five Euro question .\nOf course I'll buy the  banana .\nWhat do you what do you guys reckon ?\nOf cour Of course the most difficult question for the end .\nWell\nI'll say five .\nHmm .\nI'll say five .\nTwenty five Euros .  Cheap .\nI find it quite cheap  actually .\nI dunno . If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in\nYeah , so the target price is for all Europe , or only for rich countries ?  It's more targeting U_K_ or\nI don't know . Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or\nUh\nSo this is selling costs , not production costs .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah this is the the initial specifications .\nYeah yeah sure . Um  Five .\nI would say six . It's quite cheap actually .\nI'd say two .\nAw , should be nice in your\nWhy ?\nI don't want a banana on my  living room table , a banana remote .\nNo but it's really handy actually if you see .\nIt is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible .\nIt's it's so handy . And then\nIt's kitsch .\nAnyb anybody who comes here   anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this .\nYeah . Yeah , but it's not a positive thing .\nIt's a very positive thing if you see like that  .\nWell , you know , it's it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's a banana .\nWell , don't forget well , don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh\nYoungsters .\nyeah , youngst youngst\nYeah but it says I , I would buy this , so .\nActually maybe\nNo  well  yeah  I  if you would be young .\nYeah\nNot telling that you are young . Li li like a teenager for instance .\nNo , it's I . I would buy\nOkay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things .\nYou want to flaunt .\nYeah .\nYou  with your girlfriend or something .\nYeah , you want to show the beautiful banana you have .\nS s\nOr might be it does some other kind of thing but\nStill I I'd say two . I don't think I  at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really .\nUh yeah , crazy .\nOkay so you s you give\nI can say , maybe there is a market for it , I dunno .\noh yeah yeah I know I know .\nSo you say two .\nYeah .\nI say five .\nF I d I say five . You say ?\nI change the question .\nSo what's the new question ?\nAnd you have saved it ?\nSo yeah upload the\nYou'll have to reload .\nUh yeah , I think so .\nOkay , so , it depends if uh\nYeah it's two different situations . If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one .\nYeah that's two different question .\nIf I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it . Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look\nUgly .\nworse than a banana .\nThey're not going to be as  And they they might not be a as easy as this\nAnd it  yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use .\nyeah . Yeah .\nSo ? What now ? What range ?\nI stick to five .\nS\nAlthough it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning\nI go slightly up . Six .\nSix .\nso I dunno . Um .\nW we have six , five\nI'd give it I'd give it a\nThree\nI give it a four now .\nSix ? Six ?\nSo we are six , five , four\nSix , five , four .\nSix , so it's uh five point five , or less .\nYeah . So\nOkay .\nSo and last question , will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana . Um , zero . No uh we can't .\nSo one .\nActually yeah , I  we\nWell if  .\nYeah .\nNo uh let's say I'll put two .\nI'd say three , I mean my remote control is kinda  at home is pretty terrible . If it was  change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to\nIt's for the T_V_ .\nbut uh  'cause it's really bad but uh\nI'd say a three .\nI'll still give it five . Yeah .\nFive ?\nTwo three five two three fi and two .\nYou are romantic , really .\nSo it's somewhere three point five I think .\nI would say two .\nSo it's r Yeah , three point five .\nWho is the outlier ?\nWh wh  you said five ?\nNo no you say five , he is the outlier .\nNo I said five .\nOkay just just do a sum .\nI don't know if  it's a\nIt's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters .\nNo because there are more  yeah , we shouldn't sum like that .\nWell maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob\nBecause the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually .\nMm-hmm .\nOtherwise we wouldn't  we will not sell .\nIs there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ?\nUh no I didn't  anything .\nWell just leave it at that then .\nYeah .\nOops .\nSo maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a  out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it .\nYeah , the uh  Yeah .\nProblem with connectors ?\nDo you want me to sum\nNo .\nYeah it's it's funny .\no I think it's not\nI think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it , so .\nOkay .

So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet . Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . We should we should be below twelve point five . So I already uh put some pu some numbers here , okay . We are going to go through   so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells .\nWell we decided against the solar cells so\nMm-hmm .\nOh yeah finally we say no .\nSolar cells , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , we said no to that .\nOkay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . So hand dynamo . This something we didn't thought about . But\nYou mean , charging it by shaking the banana .\nYeah .\nI think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay so we we stick to battery , one .\nTo bring the cost  Yeah .\nNo kinetic also . I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo .\nWell maybe dynamo is like you have to actually\nAh you have to  ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana .\nS\nYeah .\nYeah .\nCrazy . Okay . So those banana is falling . Let's go ahead . So we we st only have one for battery . Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the  .\nSo we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .\nYeah . Yeah .\nAnd that's it .\nOkay . No  so we hin\nAnd we have sample speaker .\nYeah so one .\nYeah . Yeah .  the cost of that is very high .\nOoh ye ye ye the cost is increasing . So we are\nWell actually that that  no that sample speaker is not  we we're not using that , we're just using the the very beep  simple beep ,\nThe beep .\nthat s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything .\nUh-huh .\nThat's what\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nOkay so I'll remove it .\nSo  Yeah .\nS\nI say that  Yeah .\nSo don't we need a\nAnd we have sev\nOh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing .\nYeah .\nSo\nSo we we'll put some extras , if there is something .\nYeah maybe . We'll see later .\nMm .\nOkay so in  for the case um  I put single curved .\nOkay . To reduce the cost , it's okay .\nWell , wait a second ,\nBecause we have two things .\nno , it's it's double curved , it's got a c , it's uh\nOh it's got all the directions\nNo .\nso don't worry .\nWell d yeah it's monotonic  but\nIt's got a  direction .\nit's got  but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved , one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides .\nWell . What a  what i if I put one here .\nThis is actually  I mean this probably\nActually what's the differen\nthis probably actually costs more than three\nYeah so let's put one here in the  then instead of single\nif you\nOkay . Okay .\noka all right .\nYeah .\nSo we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .\nYeah . That's right .\nWell   no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber\nNo , it's too  no .\nif you drop it ?\nToo expensive .\nIt's too expensive . We're already at eleven .\nWell when  okay . Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in .\nOkay so I put rubber one . Okay so special colour , yellow .\nYeah .\nUh for the interface we have\nWe don't have any push buttons .\nNo , we have two push buttons .\nWe have three .\nNo that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that .\nHuh .\nNo no . We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons .\nAh okay , okay .\nUh .\nOkay , okay .\nAnd\nOkay it's gonna have to be plastic .\nActually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here .\nNo it's  no chip . This is just radio frequency  . Th This is no chip .\nYeah .\nYeah but\nNo . There's no chip there .\nyou need\nIt just emits the signal .\nIt's just\nAnd the receiver accepts it and that's it .\nYeah .\nFo i it does nothing actually ?\nNo . Just  only  .\nJust se sends the signal , that's it .\nIt's a recharger thing and uh\nOkay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons .\nWell I actually did um think about it myself  but I thought you know  because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a  instead of a turbo button\nYeah ,\nbut you know the turbo button does add that extra class .\nso  Yeah .\nYou know . So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that .\nOkay . So no L_C_D_ , so for  we have no button supplements , right ?\nYep . No .\nUh  well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because  oh no , these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials .\nYeah . No we're not\nSo\nwe don't need anything special for the buttons .\nOkay so we are over budget .\nYeah . So first thing which we should take care of is ,\nMake it plastic instead of rubber .\ninstead of rubber , let it be plastic .\nYeah .\nAnd then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents .\nAnd uh that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo mayb in fact n we have to put two here\nbecause it cost nothing .\nYeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of  plastic .\nYeah .\nThat's right .\nSo might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which  the cord and everything which'll go\nExactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff .\nDoes that include charging circuitry and everything ?\nThat's right .\nYeah maybe . Okay good . Wha\nYeah .\nExcellent .\nSo what do we do with the extra profits ?\nUm we'll invest in R_ and D_ .\nOkay .\nThe next fruit .\nYeah . So well we're under the the the cost . So we can go to  through to project evaluation .\nOkay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . Would  yeah , would buy .\nSorry ?\nNo we have a product which none of us would buy .\nYeah because th th the evaluation project\nWhich is different . Which is different . None of us will buy it .\nNo it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it .\nAh would buy , yeah .\nWe're n\nMassively , yeah .\nyeah . We're not in Milan or Paris .\nYeah .

Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times , so .\nThis is a battery .\nActually there were a lot of\nAnd you said the lowest  .\nThis is what we  which you can mm\nS Detachable battery .\nIt did  yeah .\nThat's 'cause I'm sick of Milan .\nYeah , for the batteries\nExtra battery , yeah .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "dynamo, batteries, solar, battery, kinetic", "dialogue_id": 109}, {"text": "Okay so um  project process .\nExac  Well in fact I I did not know  I didn't know really what to say here .\nIf uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say . So I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example .\nShould it be more like um like a status of of the  these meetings in fact .\nYeah .\nYeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much .\nI dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity .\nOh yeah it's really creative .\nAnd uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um  like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting .\nWe needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they\nYeah .\nThey like that .\nsee if they like it .\nYeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation .\nMm-hmm .\nBecause yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless .\nBiased .\nSo maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation  in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control .\nYeah . Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\n'Cause you know if  well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid , then you know , banana remote control could be fun for them as well .\nMm-hmm .\nMight have to draw a face on it . So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market .\nYep . Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ? Dunno , oranges ?\nYeah . The cost of the thing can be made more than might be . Because I think it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to .\nYeah . I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the\nInterface .\nWell just the the the circuit board that we're using inside ,\nMm-hmm .\nI'm not sure really how complicated our um\nMm-hmm .\nour needs are . I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to\nHmm .\nyou know to process that .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nSo more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_ .\nThat's right .\nThe complexity shouldn't be much higher .\nYeah .\nFor  you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would\nAnd also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff , that would be rather cool . I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_\nIntegrate .\nand not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay .  Very good .  So\nSo  What else ?\nWell done . I think we we can go\nOkay . Home ?\nhome .\nHappily satisfied .\nYeah . Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate .\nMm-hmm .\nOkay so thanks very much .\nYep .\nBye .\nOkay .\nThank you .\nThank you .\nBye .", "topic_id": 3, "keywords": "evaluation, satisfaction, meetings, creativity, ideas", "dialogue_id": 109}, {"text": "So let's start our second me meeting on  conceptual design .\nSo ,\nMm-hmm .\nas the previous meeting I will be the secretary\nMm-hmm .\nand we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh\nNo y you do the minutes first , or ?\nWhat ?\nNo ?\nI I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .\nOkay .\nYep .\nSo , we'll  S\nYeah .\ntechnical accessoire ?\nNo no no .\nInterface ?\nYeah .\nThis .\nMm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um\nMm .\nMm .\nA nice one .\nattractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .\nI'm not sure the one in the middle  is very attractive .\nYeah , it's very , you know\nIt's very big ,\nif you're\nyeah .\nYeah .\nIt's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it .  Or to recognise it ,\nOkay .\nyeah .\nYeah , why not .\nYeah . Yeah .\nWe'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,\nYeah .  Yeah .\nso .\nYeah .\nMm .\nSo the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nso maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we  I think we can attract a lot of user .\nOkay . Something else ?\nOkay . No . There  this is the three concepts of our controller .\nYeah .\nI just have one question , because for the intelligent controller ,  you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nbut as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?\nYeah , so\nBecause , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?\nY\nYeah . Maybe .\nor if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?\nUh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .\nYeah , sure .\nFor example , if you cannot find your uh  controller , you can just uh  just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .\nI\nOh yeah ,  that's a good  that's a good point , so .\nThat's true .\nOne and\nYeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .\nYeah .\nMm .\nSo you can use your gesture . That's no problem .\nYeah but how how is  how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?\nBroken arm ?\nFor limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very\nOkay . Okay .\nYeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?\nYeah .\nYep .\nBut this this  but this would never happen anyway .\nWhy ?\nYeah , they cannot speak at the same time .\nIf you have one brother and one sister\nYeah\nand they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme ,\nYeah , but the\nso they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,\nYeah but  Yeah\nYeah , it's very interesting .\nYeah but this\nso .\nbut the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control\nYeah .\nbecause the\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nI don't think it\nbut you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .\nThat's right .\nYou're not you're not obliged to share it .\nOh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .\nYeah , we can  yeah .\nYeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can  I can say channel three ,\nIt's  it's\nNo .\nso it's c come to channel three ,\nNo , but this is disadvant disadvantage .\nI don't have to\nYeah , I think it's a disadvantage .\nIt's advantage .\nYeah .\nAnd mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to\nYeah , but one other question .\nmanual controllers , eh .\nHow how much will it cost ?\nNo , more expensive maybe .\nHow much ?\nYeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .\nNo no we we d we we just are use um\nSome some efficient .\nUh if you if if you use the basic\nNo no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .\nSo you think it won't cost an  Not a lot for us ? Or ?\nYeah , I think it's uh  because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very\nYeah , but uh uh\nit's uh  yeah . It's\nBut it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh  I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .\nWell y y you have also the language problem ,\nNo it's uh  Even for the f um because the the vocabulary  the\nyou know when you\nMm-mm .\n'Cause it it have to be universal ,\nYeah . I agree with uh\nso .\nThe vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .\nYeah .\nYeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international\nYeah .\nYeah .\nremote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're  we want to sell it in France .\nYeah .\nThe recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English ,\nYeah .\nso .\nYeah , the key , the key um the key of our  the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation\nYeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or\nYeah but you know . The product  The pro\nmechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .\nIt's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe\nMm , okay .\nYeah .\nYeah ,\nAnd with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?\nit's\nOh yeah yeah yeah yeah . But\nBecause of this product uh this technology has already been developed .\nYeah , but how will you\nSo\nYeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .\nYeah . Yeah .\nIf you have the language , you have to develop for each country .\nMm .\nOh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .\nYeah , but for each country you have to do one ,\nYeah .\nbecause uh the for example for Se\nEven for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to\nOh really ?  That's\nOh .\nYeah ,\nSeems to be quite complex .\nbut then w Yeah ,\nComple\nNo , it's not so complex  .\nwe have to take care of the twelve Euros\nAnd what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?\nproblem .\nAnd where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?\nNo no no it's not  I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just  the microphone is embedded in the controller .\nYeah , but where is the controller ?\nOkay .\nWhere is the controller ?\nYeah .\nIt's in your family , in your home .\nYeah , but we're\nNo , but then it's it's like this uh\nhere it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .\nYeah . Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .\nA microphone maybe .\nYeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .\nTo talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .\nYou just want to interact with television .\nYeah yeah just  you just put the controller here , then you\nI if you say one , he switch to channel ,\nyou use your command\nYeah ,\nyeah .\nand you do s your gesture .\nbut you can lose it .\nNo no it's n y   if you lose it\nSo well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .\nYeah .\nOkay you  so you can build a kind of black box\nDevic\nand put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone  inside your remote control .\nAh .\nYeah .\nBut you would still have the buttons . Or is it  do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?\nthink it  we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think\nOkay , so you\nYeah ,\nyeah .\nyeah .\nYou can see  they can switch form one modality to another .\nMm .\nYeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky .\nI think so .\nYeah .\nNo ,\nAnd maybe it will be quite\nthat's quite inter quite attractive .\nBut I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so  although y y\nWell , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .\nYeah ,\nYeah but i i\nOkay .\nI dunno .\nWe should have confidence in technology .\nYeah , we should .  Uh .\nHmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .\nMm .\nWhat ?\nWhich kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?\nIf if  I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .\nMore features , yeah .\nYeah , but\nBut if if if it like doubles uh\nI think he need a control that is very reliable ,\nno one would would be interested .\nso .\nSo I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?\nYeah . Yeah .\nJust want to have something  controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ?\nYeah but if if you stick to um  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?\nYeah .\nYeah . No ,\nWould y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that\nI mean\nIt's not really the  we\nY\nwe can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so  or something like that . But uh I think a user need\nYeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function ,\nNo ,\nbut\nbut you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something ,\nDon't have a  the the  Yeah\nOkay .\nor\nif we can send email from it .\nBut it's not the  only the problem  only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .\nNo . No .\nBecause the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if\nCause for example  yeah .\nYeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller ,\nYeah .\nYeah , but uh we want so\nbut with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .\nYeah , you wou you would\nThat's\nTrue .\nthe feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our  from other products .\nYeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .\nYeah\nYeah .\nAnd for all the person of the family maybe ,\nYeah , uh\nYou don't need to tune it .\nso , yeah .\nYeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?\nYeah , why not ? If it's\nI mean , for example the goo y\nBecause you have new\nyou say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .\nYeah . Yeah .\nI don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . Google is  is simple , works fine ,\nYeah .\nso I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .\nYeah . Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .\nUh thi this  I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition\nThe  then nn\nor\nno .\nif he has something that works fine and is really  fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .\nTha\nNot too expensive too .\nBut the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .\nSee\nThat's the same\nThat's the problem ,\nyeah .\nyeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .\nYe\nYeah .\nBut you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product\nYeah .\nand so .\nOkay .

Okay .\nI s because i in my presentation I don't have here with\nOkay , never mind .\nso  It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r\nOkay .\nof the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside\nOkay . Okay .\nand  so . So I  in fact the the  f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,\nMm-hmm .\nso will  it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and  in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,\nMm-hmm .\nso it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nor , you know , you can see them in the darkness .\nOkay .\nOkay .\nAnd the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation\nUh-huh .\nor will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nand  so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .\nYeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control\nYeah . Yeah , yeah mm .\nand maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers\nEcologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nand but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,\nno ?\nAlrigh In fact , having them both will  if we want to have battery , regular battery and and  the solar energy battery it could be  it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,\nSo .\nbut it will be an added value also that will be compensated ,\nYeah .\nOkay .\nso hmm .\nAnd what tha what about the uh materials ?\nAnd the materials , it depends for example you  if you have a wooden material it can be more  the plastic material is more common\nImpersonal , mm-hmm .\nit's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,\nYeah .\nSpecial for\nor you know , you can have some\nYeah , and i if you  we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm . Mm .\nand it can be interesting .\nMm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .\nAnd so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .\nYeah , we want something easy to use and  so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .\nYeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nAnd you think that we will be\nYeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros ,\nOkay .\nso .\nSo wood .\nAnd what about the buttons ?\nI think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know  lighted buttons because , you know , it's  I don't know  um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion\nNo it's fashion , yeah .\nand it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .\nWhat about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .\nI think a touch screen  will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .\nMm .\nBut  And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of\nYeah .\nSo you got email ?\nI dunno .

Functional requirements ?\nUh no , trend watching .  The other one .\nThis one ?\nYeah . Uh , I think so , just  Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .\nSo again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  I mean  i i it sounds good technically\nMm .\nMm .\nbut it's it's not what they want and uh  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .\nOkay .\nAt the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .\nNow i if we look at fashion in general um  Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,\nAh yes .\nokay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .\nYeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .\n'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .\nOkay .\nSo we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris\nAnd fruit and vegetables yeah .\nwe go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,\nSpongy  'Kay .\nokay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .\nOkay , yeah , yeah .\nI dunno .\nYeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?\nYeah thi this is this would be like um\nPla S\nplastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh\nVery stuff  Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah .

It depends on the design we want ,\nYeah , maybe the base .\nso .\nIt's it's natural .\nBut still y\nTh The feeling is natural ,\nYeah , it's natural\nYeah .\nand i\nso maybe we can stay with wood .\nAnd it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol\nYeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .\nMm , yeah , it's not right , so .\nBut it's still fashion .\nBut we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,\nOkay .\nor\nYeah ,\nI dunno .\nsomething that you can  into it .\nYeah .\nUh and what about the user interface concept ?\nGoogle and\nGoogle and fancy ?\nand fancy , f how about the the voice ?  And\nBecause I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .\nUh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested\nUh yes .\nand how   It It is an an interesting concept to see  to have uh voice control .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah .\nMm . Yeah .\nThe smart controller .\nBut  and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually ,\nYeah ,\nso .\nbut you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .\nBut it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .\nThat's true .\nYeah  d\nOkay .\nSo maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,\nI dunno .\nMm .\nmaybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .\nYeah . It's good .\nAnd L_C_D_ buttons .\nYeah , L_C_D_ .\nYeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .\nYeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to\nWhat interface ?\nYeah , for the interface something  added value .\nI think the supplement can be the voice  . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of\nWith a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use\nYeah , yeah .\ncommands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .\nYeah . Mm .\nMm-hmm .\nTo push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four .\nTurning the T_V_ o on o or off .\nYeah , turning   yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,\nSo ,\nso .\nadding some vocal commands .\nYeah .\nSimple ones ?\nYeah , simple ones for\nOkay .  So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes  so  we'll  you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .\nYeah .\nYep . Yeah .\nUh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons\nexpensive buttons   Yeah , to make some new\nand try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .\nYeah .\nAnd I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .\nYeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .\nYeah .\nOkay , fruits .\nYeah .\nIf possible .\nOkay .\nAnd remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really  it will be seen in the remote control .\nNeed it to be , okay .\nSo you will have  Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control ,\nYeah .\nOkay .\nso you will have to model model something .\nOkay . Yep\nAnd I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\nOkay .\nSo ,\nOkay .\nno more questions , we can close the session .\nSounds good , mm-hmm .\nHmm .\nYeah .

Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh  uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , uh one that everybody wants , uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh  just as vital to this project\nMm .\num  I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um  designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um .  What's uh  the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh  everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um  everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh  uh everybody's experience is please do so . Uh in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you  you're looking to make . So we'll start with Andrew .\nOh my name's Andrew I'm a  I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to  like  and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .\nRight  Kendra .\nI'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um  I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be  working on the design .\nRight at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so .\nRight . Yep , I'm just open to being creative .\nUh I'm Katie ,\nYep , good .\nI'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh  yeah .\nOkay , very very quickly , um  this  I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . Everybody says what they  what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up\nand think oh yes that's  it's obvious how that works , uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that  I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh  let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um  In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um So I I  everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal .\nUm , badger .\nMm and why ?\nUh it's it's got nice contrast with black  and white and uh\nUh-huh .\nI feel they're  underdog kind of status\nOh right\nand they're , the\nuh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it .\nUm probably a duck\nKendra .\nI just  I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever .\nUh-huh . Right , okay .\nUh 's horses , no particular reason why  .\nUh-huh ,  fair enough yeah .\nI'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien\nbecause of their  their uh overall ability to uh uh\nMake mobile phones and T_V_ remotes\nSorry ?\nto make T_V_ remotes  .\nIndeed absolutely yes ,\ntha that's um  Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh  we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent .  It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price .

Um , but that  it's easy to  if you can switch back and forth instead of having to  press a bunch of different buttons\nNo .\nand  so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know .\nAny any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ?\nUm   I think it's important that you should be able to  when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it  the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nThink a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and  T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't\nMm .\nlike an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain .\nMm .\nLike it's very  a very  like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like  Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .\nUm what so wh what's in in  what particular style features are you thinking about ?\nUm . Something that looks looks  doesn't look like remote control .\nSo if you want ,  something that looks like uh  something that makes you think oh what's this ? Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen ,\nUh-huh .\nbut it makes you think oh .\n. Yeah\nSo , sorry that's a bit vague  .\nd no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control ,  people won't see it as a remote control um and uh\nUh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product .\nUh-huh . Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a  of remote controls ?\nI think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things\nMm .\nMm .\nand uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto ,\nso something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better .\nI mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops\nMm .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm .\nand s you know some quite fancy ones um than the\nYeah .\nsome from personal experience which look nice\nbut  aren't particularly comfortable . Um  any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh\nYeah .\nWell from the mouse idea you could ,  remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want   could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button .\nYes , I mean  the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh\nMm .\nI suppose .\nfi find the button buttons easily .\nEasily , yeah yeah .\nBut maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them  be kind of down so you could feel them\nMm .\nMm .\nbetter .\nYeah , that's uh  must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh  certainly be different . Um do we need it to uh  I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all .\nOh yeah .\nDo we do we want uh\nMm that would be good .\nLike a like a mobile phone ?\nYeah .\nMm .\nYeah .\nMm .\nMm , yeah that would be good .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "buttons, remotes, controls, remote, button", "dialogue_id": 111}, {"text": "Okay .

But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation .\nSo frustrating .\nYeah .\nSo\nYeah . I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . I have to do that so switch .\nYeah  Yeah exactly . This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so\nYeah .\nMm .\nReally annoying .\nOkay . So there we are again .\nBy your humble P_M_ .\nYeah .\nOkay this is the agenda . Um we have three presentations , I heard .\nReally .\nYeah really .  So who wants to start ?\nYeah that's fine  .\nYeah .\nWe have to start it right away ?\nYeah . Uh this is you ?\nFunctional ? Yeah functional requirements .\n'Kay .\nAlright . I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . Um  Well uh some research has be done uh has been done . Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls .  Users think they're ugly . Um  they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . Um  they are often lost somewhere in the room . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . And they're bad for R_S_I_ .  I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . Um\nTs\nthere is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . Um but they are used . I mean the\nSo they do need to be in the\nYeah .\nYeah they do need to be on the on the remote control .\nAlright .\nI mean if you can't control the the sound settings  I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that .\noften .\nSo um yeah we have to .\nBy the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but\nWe c we c Yeah I mean w we can't\nNext generation does .\nokay .\nmy my T_V_ has ,\nNo .  Alright .\nbut we we can leave them uh away . Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves I guess . Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future .\nN not used anymore .\nSo forget this one .\nOkay .\nUh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order .\nYeah .\nBy the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ?\nYeah .  I was wondering uh\nI didn't get anything .\nYeah ,  on on the project uh\nYeah . Not by mail . I receiv the mail but you don't . So\nBut you you've got more information than  uh .\nNo so it's a text file n in the project folder . So teletext can be skipped .\nThat's in the presentation , so\nAlright .\nUm there was some research on new features in a remote control . Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition . Well we got an update for the for the audience . Or the the the targeted group . So it's above forty I guess .\nUh below I believe .\nThe new product ? Or below\nYeah below forty .\nbecause that's pretty relevant .\nMm-hmm .\nI thought I read a\nOur current customers are in the age group forty plus .\nYeah ?\nAnd the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty .\nBelow ? Okay well\nBut where did you get uh that information ?\nThat's in a newsflash .\nthat's that's in the newsfla\nOkay .\nokay that's a good to know . Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features .\nYeah .\nI mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . So I think we can build that in . Um  Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . Um and and also there's  so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical uh aspect of it . Um  And I think  and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control  in your room .\nYeah .\nIt's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . So it's  the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh\nYeah . But it also needs to have corporate identity .\nYeah so the the logo has to be\nPresent and the colours .\nuh present yeah , and the colours as well .\nSo we can't change much of that .\nDo we have  uh yeah  .\nYeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it .\nMm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .\nSo I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much .\nOkay .\nWell that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part .\n'Kay .\nAlright .\nYes .\nOkay .\nIt's open already so you can use  to\n.\nfind yours .\nMm . It's\nF_ five .\nF_ five . Okay .\nGo Jurgen .\nOh . What is this ?\nOh no .\nHow do I uh\nYou pressed alt F_ four ?\nNo no no . I pressed the mouse button .\nOh great .\nIt's  th that's the self-destruct button .\nYeah .\nYeah . Okay .\nUh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it .\nOkay . Um if you all go stand around uh\nYeah . Just  yeah .\nYeah .\nComputer\nAlright .\nSure .\nUm\nThat's nice .\nNo .\nF_ five . Yeah .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nAlright .\nI uh had uh two examples .\nMm-hmm .\nUm this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons .\nMm-hmm .\nThis the easy one\nYeah .\nI think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nUm but yeah the the age is uh under forty ?\nThe mm yeah .\nYeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions .\nSo we  Okay so so we have the option for more functions .\nSo not not too much but  yeah .\nUm  yeah .\nAnd we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech\nAnd the speech recognition yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nalright .\nUh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . But\nYeah from age of sixteen so yeah .\nYeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button .\nMm .\nMm-hmm .\nMm-hmm .\nBut if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option .\nYeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television .\nOkay one device .\nYeah . So n it's very easy .\nOkay . I didn't see  .\nSo w\nNow yeah it's okay .\nOkay and I also uh yeah . W yeah .\nSo there are not extra options in this case , but uh\nOkay .\nWe have to make it fashionable . Like you uh said uh before .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nUh yeah the basic functions . Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed .\nYeah so maybe you can hide them or something .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen .\nYeah you make a screen menu or something .\nAnd the and the  yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand then the basic function just on the device itself .\nMm-hmm .\nSo it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu .\nYeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen .\nYeah .\nWhat does the screen do ?\nDid I uh\nAlright .\nUh .  What are  wh\nYeah . It's low power .\ndid I break it ?\nWhat  .\nSo what does the screen do ? They said they needed it but what does it do ? What do they want with the screen ?\nFor for the advanced functions I think .\nYeah that's what we make it up .\nYeah well it  yeah it didn't\nSo but what did the marketing\nit didn't say what they want to do with the screen .\nNo .\nWell I , my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions .\nYeah okay it's handy . With no predefined uh\nLike searching for channels and\nAh look .\nYeah searching for channels , programming them .\nYeah .\nWe have your uh  oh never mind .\nWe're back online .\nOkay . That's uh  I'm al I'm almost finished so\nOkay .\nUm the  we have to to to watch out for the  i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable\nMm-hmm . Content and form .\nyeah content and form .\n.\nYeah .\nYeah .\nNow that that was uh was the end .\nThat was the end . Okay .\nYes .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nWell my presentation is a bit uh sucky .\nWell you can improvise right ?\nUh which one is it ? Technical functions ?\nYeah a little bit .\nThis one ?\nUh no . No no .\nFunctional requirements ?\nYeah I think that would be it then .\nNo .\nYou didn't put it in ? Or\nI have no idea .\nSo we we can go for\nThat w  .\nit's not really English .\nLet me check . I know .\nUh kick off . Oh working design I got it .\nYeah .\nSo we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it .\nHere you go .\nAlright how do I uh skip pages ?\nJust uh press uh  yeah . Yeah .\nThe keys yeah ?\nYeah .\nAlright . Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd well the info on the website which came too late .\nMm-hmm .\nUm so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet .\nMm-hmm .\nSo uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . Those were my uh starting points .\nMm-hmm .\nUh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself .\nMm .\nAnd then make the\nDesign yeah .\nthe design , a the actual design ,\nDesign ? Yeah .\nbut I never came around to do that . So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it .\nOkay .\nI mean everything speaks for itself I guess . Mean you press a button um  the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip ,\nMm-hmm .\nwhich uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah frequency . Yeah .\nAnd uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_\nYeah decoder .\nand the T_V_ will translate it into a function . Um   Yeah well this was actually  all I got around to do .\nBlank . Yeah okay .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but uh\nWork harder .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "desktop, newsflash, presentation, screen, message", "dialogue_id": 112}, {"text": "Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh\nYeah . Whatever .\nYeah . Uh\nYeah we want to incorporate in uh into it .\nYeah .\n'Kay . Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well .\nMm .\nAnd uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . We have to make be clear what that is .\ngroup of users , or\nYeah users .\nbecause it says below forty I mean .\nYeah so I think it's easy but\nI guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female\nBut uh it's it's also for children or just uh\nYeah it's below forty so we can decide where to\nUh six  the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen .\nOkay . Okay .\nSixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that .\nOkay . So below forty is okay .\nSo um\nBut we need an  lower level which to s uh focus .\nHow do you mean ?\nSo is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ?\nUh sixteen to forty .\nYeah ? 'Kay .\nYeah . We we have to\nWell I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology .\nYeah .\nSo they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess .\nAnd if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product .\nYeah .\nYeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean .\nMm-hmm .\nThe uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote .\nDesign . Mm .\nAnd yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever .\nYeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .  And maybe y\nExperienced yeah .\nBut uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ?\nNa I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display .\nYeah\nYeah .\nlike like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ?\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah . So is  you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are\nUh you can make a  if you make a drawing .\nYeah .\nYeah . Aye yeah .\nUh  Uh  .\nShall I uh\nUh black's okay .  And draw it very big .\nYeah . It's okay .\nOh .  Yeah .\nno , it doesn't have line control , so\nYeah .\nYeah we get the\nYeah well , this is basically uh it's\nThe remote ?\nThe remote , yeah ?\nalright the remote ? Um well usually the power button is on top I guess .\nBasic . Is on top . Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb .\nYeah so it should fit right in into your hand .\nYeah . L left top or right uh top ?\nT I s should said right .\nRight . Right .\nYeah , right .\nRight top .\nI most people are right-handed so\nOkay .\nYeah definitely .\nmaybe left-handed special addition , but okay .\nIf you put it like like here . Or something . I dunno . Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah .\nDo the also with the thumb . So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly .\nOkay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle .\nYou you need to be able to hold it so\nYeah .\nYeah .\nOkay for example  if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout .\nYeah okay that's true . Layout . That's for the\nDoesn't work too well . It's uh it's bent .\nI can't help it .\n.\nYou broke it .\nYeah .\nYeah .\n.\nMan .\nRight .\nYeah okay .\nOkay you get it . Uh for example if y if you put all the\nRight .\nYou want the normal piece of paper ? And you have a pen ?\nYeah .\nAnd might be easier huh ?\nMaybe this .  kind of works .\nYeah ?\nLike if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels ,\nMm-hmm . Uh .\num and here one for for\nAnd the for flipping up and down .\nYeah yeah . And volume control .\nYeah that that usually uh  like here , here , here , here .\nYeah I\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh\nAnd left to right . And those can also be used for the menu .\nYeah exactly . I thought  but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things\nAnd you you have\nAnd\nmost of the time you have one button in the middle . It says menu ,\nYeah okay .\nFor the menu . Yeah .\nand then if you press it you  the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nand then just\nYeah .\nmo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action .\nYeah .\nSo you scroll into it , okay . You select a function like v like uh bass . You just adjust it with these two buttons .\nYeah .\nThen okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd then finally say okay , exit . Or or one button to exit it .\nYeah .\nUh in one time I dunno , that's not really my department .\nAnd do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or\nThat's more your uh your department to to uh to\nYeah .\nYeah . But it should be  if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top ,\nOn the left uh top yeah .\nyeah . I mean it's uh\nYeah but that depends on where you put the screen .\nOkay .\nBut it's essential that there is a screen .\nYeah . Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than  I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there .\nYeah . And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone .\nBut um  Yeah so it should be  I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe .\nYeah . This would be uh\nWhy did we wanna put the display in the bottom ?\nI mean i\nNo that's not s sure so\nOkay .\nThat's not sure\nuh we need a display .\nbut it's\nYeah may maybe because you're\nBecause yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display .\nYeah okay but  only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then  yeah .\nYeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me .\nNormal for logical t\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAlso because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top .\nYeah they're used to it .\nOkay the  yeah . That's possible .\nSo you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button .\nYeah .\nI mean if you grab it .\nOn once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button .\nBut most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on .\nYeah , okay . Okay we put it on top .\nSo we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo\nYeah .\nlike over here . R_R_ . And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small . If you look at your mobile phones  are some stripes ,  little little holes .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe on the top or even on the side .\nYeah maybe on the side . I mean if the if the microphone is good .\nYeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so\nYeah .\nTrue .\nYeah okay . So on the on the top is better .\nI think that top is the best option .\nBut if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side\nYeah okay .\nI dunno . Should be able to work .\nYeah .  .\nDepends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay .\nNever mind . Can we leave this up to you ?\nYeah it doesn't matter that much . So  but um the screen is on top ? Which functions did we have left ? I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down .\nVolume . Up . Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options .\nScreen is over there .\nSo maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen .\nYeah . If we\nYeah . Yeah . That's uh that's a good one .\nYeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ?\nYeah so sounds ?\nLike uh bass uh\nYeah . Sound ?\nso we need kind of an equaliser . If you\nYeah . Equaliser . So if you have sound  But not too advanced . I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass .\nYeah\nYeah it it's just a remote control so\nand they're\nYeah treble , middl middle , bass or something .\nThey're not used often so\nYeah .\nYeah . It's uh pretty hard to write .\nAh as\nYeah just\n.\nMm . Okay but you have sound ?\nYeah sounds .\nYeah just\nYeah .\noh y you have digital uh\n.\nbetter write it down over there yeah .\nOf course . I'm just a  secretary .\nSo you have sound .\nYeah .\nCoffee ?\nUh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ?\nYes please .\nTreble bass .\nthe mono stereo option ?\nYeah . Also .\nUh\nAnd there there was something else also .\nPitch I believe , yeah .\nAnd then pitch .\nPitch . Yeah . But pitch , isn't that  yeah that's the the height of the tone .\nYeah .\nThe fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah .\nYeah okay ,\nYeah and mono stereo .\nwh why would you use that ?\nYeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching .\nIf people like talk like uh\nMm .\nYeah .\nAnd also the tuning part ?\nProgramming part .\nYeah programming . So channel programming ?\nUh so we have sound , yeah ? Channel programming .\nAnd yeah in the functionality of the\nTelevision uh itself uh\nno no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? As a confirmation or whatever you know ?\nMm .\nMm .\nMm .\nI dunno .\nI think it g it gets annoying .\nYeah .\nI mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but\nWe we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s\nUnder the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things .\nYeah . But uh the the television itself has also the the options  brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . So\nYeah .\nContrast yeah .\nyeah .\nYeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with  only three buttons then it's very hard to\nMm . No . Uh , so contrast ,\ny yeah contrast and brightness ?\nYeah .\nbright ,\nYeah those are the most used I guess . If you look at your monitor .\nuh  And the others were in your presentation right ? So I can just copy those ?\nWell  yeah well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess .\nOkay .  It's easy .\nBut so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this .\nYeah . I will look it up .\nYeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options .\nThe sound , sound and image . And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options .\nIndeed .\nYeah .\nSo we need two menus kind of thing .\nYeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle .\nUh-huh .\nAnd the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah .\nYeah with the chip and then  I mean\nSo you  You have an additional processor and and software part .\nUh  yeah . Well  yeah we have power button , whether that's present .\nCompared to o\nAlright .\nMm-hmm .\nChannel volume selection present . Uh numbers present . Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour .\nL_ s Yeah . Colour . Yeah I I call it contrast .\nYeah con contrast is\nYeah I make it c colour .\nYeah okay , colour and brightness .\nYeah .\nUm and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . And then you can um\nYeah and automatically um  Mm-hmm .\nUh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it .\nYeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ?\nYeah , autoseek .\nUh name a channel , or\nWell most T_V_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable .\nOh they get automatic names , okay .\nYeah . So you only have to choose the position on your\n.\nIt only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_ , with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote .\nYeah . Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or\nHelp .\nIf you already programmed it .\nYeah .\nIf you want to move it . Yeah that should be possible too .\nYeah . How do you call that ?\nYeah how do you call that ? Mm ? Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible .\nChannels ? Yeah .\nI mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever .\nNinety nine or something . Yeah .\nJust browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed .\nS swap channels ? Can I call it that ?\nYeah . Swap channels .\nSwap's good option . Okay . Uh other functions ?\nSo you  most of the time if you if you swap it  S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five . And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one .\nMm-hmm .  Okay . Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer .\nYeah . It's it's pretty uh\nOkay .\nyeah I mean you have to look on on the menu\nworking design . Doch .\nAlso .\non the T_V_ .\nThat's  you're\nHe only has to figure out how it has to look .\nYeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ?\nAnd how\nYeah .\nto use\nAnd the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe .\nYeah okay . But  You did your homework . But um  yeah . Okay .\nYeah .\nOr or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? To programme the channels ?\nNo I don't think so .\nNo no . It should be able to do any remote .\nNo that's\nUh .\nBut I think the communication with the television is difficult . But that's not our part .\nYeah .\nWe don't have to design a protocol so\nNo .\nNo .\nThat's true . That's true .\nThank god .\nOkay", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "groups, group, management, functionality, programmed", "dialogue_id": 112}, {"text": "Yeah . So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem .\nNo that's the\nI mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's it's saved . It's easier ,  it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap .\nYeah . So but\nSo we have to think of something for that .\nUm  The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function I put them on the\nYeah k kind of structure into layers .\nOn the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the  yeah 'cause it's now  there are lots and lots of documents\n. Yeah . Yeah I can .\nand\nI'll just try to reorganise uh things . Um\nSo\nSo you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ? Uh um  I think\nAnd and the layout of of the thing itself .\nth I think the yeah the layout of the screen\nThe the layout of the remote control ?\nand I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the\n.\nIsn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ?\n. No I d I think that's more in   .\nUh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department .\nMaybe more on\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI have to know what it has to do , so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design .\nOkay . So he's layout and you're function .\nYeah .\nForm function okay .\nI think that's a that's a good separation .\nOkay .\nBut do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also ? Or\nYeah .\nAre you going to do that ?\nMm .\nYeah . Yeah I guess so .\nYeah ? I I'm going to make\nI think i that's your department yes ,\nyeah o okay .\nbecause w he already knows what\nYeah we have to kind of work together .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nIf if I make the the the yeah the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu ,\nBut we're not allowed .\nand then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly .\nYeah . Okay . Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with  pages and yeah .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI think  yeah .\nWith with some l with some layers in it .\nYeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result ,\nSo some menus .\nbecause that's always the difficulty .\nYeah .\nEvery device has its own\nYeah .\nYeah . Well I guess this this button , the the the okay ,\nMenu okay .\nmenu okay . Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . Uh like uh for your mobile phone . Um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it .\nMm .\nAnd then one to confirm , and one to go one step back .\nBack . Yeah .\nSo it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . Or the or the no button .\nMm-hmm .\nTo go one step back you  it's only two extra buttons ,\nYeah . W we\nbut if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen\nUh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . Um the  one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and\nYeah .\nYeah but they're incorporated  ? Up and down is\nYeah okay but we we have a m\nYeah because this this is used for both .\nyeah but maybe that's that's not uh\nSmart ?\nyeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display .\nInto your screen . Okay . So you\nYou wanna separate uh\nl should leave the menu button out of here .\nYeah .\nAnd  and just put it under the screen , the screen\nPut it on top .\nYeah j just just group group the  yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions .\nMm-hmm .\nSo we make a yeah a line between them .\nYeah . But we should place the screen on top , right ?\nWell\nF oh yeah . Okay yeah we swap uh   Okay .\nBut that's uh J Jurgen's department .\nYeah .\nYeah . So we make it a\nYeah . You just you just find out and  .\nYou just make the layout . You\nOkay .\ndo we do the extra two buttons or not ?\nUh\nI think you should .\nYeah .\nIt's easier . If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing .\nYeah okay . That's true .\nYeah .\nYeah . So we have a a menu button and a s\nAnd to , okay and back , also .\nOkay . Okay and back button .\nYeah . Yeah , or confirm and back . Whatever .\nAnd of course the four arrows .\nYeah .\nNo .\nBut those are still y doubly used . Both the L_C_D_\nShould we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ?\nYeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . We have a menu button and\nYeah .\nYeah . That that just to to activate the screen . So\nThat's the the one with the  yeah okay .\nMenu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen .\nAnd then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate .\nYou can navigate .\nOkay .\nBut you can also navigate the channels . And the volume .\nOkay so that that's not uh  Yeah that  Those are\nThose are both both\nmultifunctional .\nyeah .\nHey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up .\nYeah . L l litten up yeah .\nYeah .\nOh five minutes .\nThat's very good idea .\nN\nAlright .\nLight uh\nYeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use .\nYeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button .\nYeah sure .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nUm\nSo\nAnything else ?\nThose buttons are are lit up .\nI think not .\nBut just one thing . Should we use those two ? Them ? Or only this to to scroll ?\nI've\nAnd then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ? Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ?\nVolume .\nYeah .\nYeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu .\nYeah . And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . And then just only a back button .\nWell we have those buttons . We use all four .\nNo\nThe pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , sorry\nYeah okay go ahead .\nYeah ?\nsorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice .\nYeah . So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button .\nYeah .\nYeah that was already decided .\nAnd one back .\nYeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh  yeah m a multifunctional navigation button .\nOkay that's what we decided earlier on .\nYeah okay . Yeah .\nRight okay . So\nYeah .\nYou wanna close down huh ?\nyeah I wanna close down .\nI have to , sorry .\nYeah .\nit's not because I don't like you but\nYeah .\nThat's okay .\nyh we have lunch break ,\nAlready .\nand then we can work for thirty minutes , and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . And then uh we'll see\nYeah .\nAlright . How m how long is the lunchbreak ?\nI don't know . Nobody told me .\nWe have to ask .\nBut do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now ? Or first lunchbreak ?\nOkay .\nNo I th believe there's first lunch break .\nBecause I  I've everything in my head now  so\nYeah . Or you can just\nMm .\nOkay .\nYeah ?\nYeah .\n'Kay .\nYes .\nI think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and\n'Kay .\nThis is\nYeah .\nYeah .\nYes sir .\nTime pressure .\n'Kay . Yeah it's a lot of pressure .\nYeah . Sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh .\nThat's okay . Oh yeah .\nOh no no .\nYeah we'll kick your ass later . No .  Uh .\nBring it on .\nI don't know if it works but it should be saved .\nAye  Y you saved it ? Does it save automatically in the project folder ? Or\nYeah . It's uh\nOkay . We'll see .\nShould be here . Smart board .\nJust put back my laptop .\nDon't know if you can use it but\nAlright .\nOkay .\nYeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that .\nAnd uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered .\nYeah . I try to organise it by these three .\n. It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the\nYeah  yeah yeah .\nI don't really mind . I just put the minutes here and we'll see .\nBut you got some extra information uh\nYeah that's in the functional design uh folder .\nOkay .\nYeah . Yeah that's just basically what I just showed .\nBut where do you did you get the newsflash ?\nYeah . Yeah I got it by\nYou're the only one uh  okay .\nyeah . I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so\ninternet .\nOkay .\nAlright .\nAlright .\nYeah .\nMake me proud .\nI'll try to .\nSo first we have a lunchbreak now ?\nYeah .\nAlright .\nI believe so .  just ask .\nMm-hmm .

Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick ,  L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . Um we were also going to use  novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . Um that pretty much sums up the last one . So we'll just crack on , um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible .\nUh uh okay .\nUm uh the con today is the concep today .\nI'll just\nThis uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um  Sorry about this .  . And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , can we uh outsource these from elsewhere , um will we have to construct any items ourselves ?\nUh I have a presentation  I just saved it in the uh the folder .\nYeah , okay well I'll just uh I'll load it up then .

We've got trend watching , that's you .\nIt's uh  Components design .\nComponents design .\n.\nOkay .", "topic_id": 0, "keywords": "design, meeting, remote, designer, requirements", "dialogue_id": 113}, {"text": "Alright .  So   Uh . The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . Uh but later on  we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . So uh we decide what it's gonna be . Probably plastic . Uh we need the infra-red transmitter . Get that off the shelf . Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um  if you go on to the next slide . Uh   If you go on to f uh findings , it's like two or three slides down .\nOkay .\nRight . So , this is what I found we can use . Uh three different types of batteries . Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one .\nOkay . Now ,\nUm .\nthe kinetic one , we've  'cause that's the ones where like you  the movement causes it .\nCost is  Yeah .\nYeah .\nUm the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query .\nMm .\nIs a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ?\nThere's also a watch moves around a great deal more .\nDo you think ?\nUh .\nYeah .\nW\nYeah , I don't think it would . Um . And solar cells , I dunno about that .\nyeah .\nUh . We should probably just use conventional batteries . Um , just like in usual remote controls .\nWhich I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ?\nUm . Yeah . Um .  And these are three different types of  or two different types  three different types of shapes you can have . Uh one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . Um  the materials are tha there as you can see , but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved ,\nTitanium , the really strong metal , titanium ?\nuh which would be  Yeah ,\nIs it not also it's expensive ?\nand light . Uh , i think so as well , yeah .\nUm . Um .\nThey make mountain bikes out of that , don't they . So it's really light as well .\nCurious . Um , I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ?\nUm .  T yeah .\nUm could you maybe draw something ? I you don't doesn't have to be perfect , it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two .\nUh . Well for a curved , well I was thinking to  f for to sit in your  the palm of your hand . Uh maybe like this , with the uh joy pad here . Joystick here . And maybe um an okay button around here , so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . Um I don't exactly   Double curved . It probably means  this is probably double curved . Uh whereas a single curved would be like that . I guess . Or not necessarily .\nSo it might literally just be\nTwo curves  .\nokay .\nYeah like that . Whereas this is two curves . Um  so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve .\nAlright .\nUm which obviously  it looks better than the single curve , but uh you can't have it in titanium , which is uh a nice material .  Uh\nMm .\nand for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . So you have to decide , there's trade-offs there . Um  if you want the buttons to be  oh yeah , if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . But  you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . You wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . So um I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . Do you think ?\nOkay , that was definitely something we can talk about . Um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ?\nYeah . So , depends where gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display .\nUm , do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ?\nNeed an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . Is that  did I\nWell I think compared to say just pressing  buttons .\nYep .\nAdvanced , like three eight six advance .\nif you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red , whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made .\nOkay . Okay , sure .\nMm .\nIf I've not over-stepped . Yeah ?\nYeah i\nOkay , um should I go on , or go back ?\nUm\nMm , if we only have twelve Pounds fifty , twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds . Twelve Euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ?\nWell we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such . I assume .\nOkay , that's good point .\nWe have to look into the costs of those . So , sorry .\nUh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier .\nOkay .\nAnd uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip . So that's just how the control works inside . Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use .\nOkay .\n.\nUm .  . So in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ?\nUm  I think we can do it if  uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . Um and then maybe use single curved uh case . Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ .\nUm I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . Um conventional battery would seem to make sense .\nMm-hmm .\nUm I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and I'm  I don't know about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ?  .\nMm . Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail .\nOkay .\nI also have a preference for rubber .\nOkay , well um\nBased on my research .\nYeah , well will we move on to user interface , and\n.\nyeah ? Um sorry ,\nMm .\nas long as  were you ? Yeah . Okay .\nYep I'm finished .\nUm  and d d d interface concept .\nYep . Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh  and the white board\nYeah .\n'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time . Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all . I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . Um so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , um so that if r a if  so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . Um so uh next slide , if you please . Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um  v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something f  and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um\ndigital .\nf f f  for di for digital or um or for  or for cable , whatever ,\nAh , okay .\nyou're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then um your V_C_ uh and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player . And or um  box . So it's not  I'm not really excessively concerned about that . You must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right  left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . Um , so you\nCan I just jump in slightly there ?\nMm-hmm .\nThat would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then .\nYes , absolutely .\nokay .\nUm , basi  basically what I  basically what the  what  be having um , I would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the L_C_  the L_C_D_ and the uh   The joystick would be in the right place . And  also this is  a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the  the um you know the whole thing you know  it should have sort of organic feel to it\nMm .\nthat it should be , you know , soft to touch and can be moved around all nice . Um okay\nOkay .\non to  on to the next uh to the next slide .\nUm , yeah . Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well ,\nOkay .\nbecause I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say , I guess .\nYeah , 'kay basically um   I can add pretty pictures to this . The um  Assuming the hand  the hand to be in about sort of this position , um  hol uh holding the remote , the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . Um and it would need t there would need to be a  it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . So . You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . You just have big  two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can  in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . Um , and that\nIs this the joystick ?\nTh  this part here is the joystick . This would be the actual grip . Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well .\nOkay .\nThat would be probably the bulkiest part . And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . So it would fit just nicely in the hand . And again , this part could be rotated , so it can   So  so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . Um  So the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . Um now programming it  actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . Programming them can be a right pain . So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some  some fair iv  fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you  on your  computer just so that you could um pr  program it at a rather  in a rather more comfortable interface . And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . Um though you  i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a  ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . Um . But uh . Yeah .\nMm .\nThat's that's my idea .\nOkay .  Excellent , right . Um  uh .", "topic_id": 1, "keywords": "batteries, battery, bat, kinetic, joystick", "dialogue_id": 113}, {"text": "Mm . 'Kay .\nFile open .\nWe go .\nTrend watching .\nOkay .  So uh to gather my research , two basic methods . We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , what's what's the new black ,\nOkay .\nyou know , as it goes .  Next slide please . Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know .  They want it to be  that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . Technology technical  technologically innovative . People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . So like the interface is really important .  And easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important  I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . People want it  I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use ,  prefer it to have the newest features . And if it's easy to use that's a bonus .  The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . How that relates to a remote control I don't know .\nBut I I see  I come on to that in the next in the next slide . Spongy . I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . Well spongy's the new black as well . So we have the choice between rubber and plastic . If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then  can I skip the rest ?\nOh yeah , I forgot to mention that . The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber .\nOkay . Okay , so\nForgot to say that .\nkinda spongy material .\nOkay .\nSo um so my personal opinion ?  Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool , that's that's different , you know , that's  everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something cool . Like , titanium is cool but it's expensive . And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . Um  I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for  it's the up to the interface guy . So if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . It could be something like , I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . So I think cool is the key .  Few questions about a spongy remote control . I've never seen one before . I've seen plastic remote controls . I think maybe they were  I don't know , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being\nMm-hmm .\nsturdy , you know . For being strong and sturdy . So um if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , you know . I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . So how do things fit it ? And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that , so . So just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus  doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg . We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it . People like spongy material . If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . And also , this was this year . So , things change all the time , every year you know they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . Well next year something else is gonna be the new black\nMm-hmm .\nand we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff .\nOkay .\n'Kay . That's me .\nWell , um I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . You always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . Um .\nMm-hmm .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "technology, technologically, innovative, trend, controls", "dialogue_id": 113}, {"text": "Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , so  I don't exactly what cost would be incurred . Um I can see your point about the number keypad , but I've  I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels .\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nMy feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um  boxes as well um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be\nYeah , actually  if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau   it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . It's just irritating .\nThat's a good point .\nBut if you h  but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them .\nMm-hmm .\nYou can incorporate names into the menu . Okay .\nSo you\nOkay .\nEven news , music . Like they do on uh sky digital kinda .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nSo what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um , say something like um lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um  Looks like we  going for a double curved design . Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . Though I'd have to say  depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .\nYeah , I I would say definitely , I mean  I mean I mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . So\nDo you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? I can see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ?\nMm  .\nThat would be a worry of mine .\nIf you're going with the fruit and veg thing ,  looks like a banana .\nI d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a  a structural weakness ,\n.\nF if you wanna design it that way .\nI mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , and I think would look rather co I mean  mi  rather cool . I mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice , it makes it  makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control ,\nbut uh .\nYeah , we won't add that functionality .\nOkay . Course not .\nHowever , one interesting point is , I don't know how serious you were there , but we  if we take some of the ideas  why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ?\nYeah .\nSure , yeah .\nOkay .\nI dunno .\nMm-hmm .\nIt's an  certainly a different colour from your average um\nMake it harder to lose , as well .\nYeah .\nThat's true .\nSure .\nWas there anything in your research\nThe noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control ,  it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep .\nY you know , you lose the monkey  the banana ,\nmonkey  .\ny  you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana .\nI th uh I mean if it  I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though maybe have monkey as default . Um .\nS oh , I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television .\nMm-hmm .\nBut why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , I I don't know .\nWell basi  basically the um for  f for uh  I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic  will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to .\nMm-hmm .\nIt's not simply a matter of frequency .\nYeah .\nSo um  usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi  you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer\nMm-hmm .\nand try the different codes that\nMm-hmm .\ncome under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one .\nThat's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it  .\nYeah , that's right .\nOkay .\nSo that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .\nAn interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_\nYeah .\nand then they maybe look up different names of um  different actual units that have been produced .\nYeah .\nOr we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such .\nIs it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ?\nUm booklet .  Some pages .\nI was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , so\nYeah .\nDoesn't have to be used very often\nonce every s\nthat's right , yeah .\nYeah ,\nYeah . But it's a but it's a nuisance .\nand it's\nAnd it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it , so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about .\nMm .\nIf you  if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's  that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . Um mm .\nMm .\nOkay , this   just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage .\nMm .\nI'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . This is the conceptual one . Um . I think we've come up  I think we've covered everything we need to here . Um I think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such , so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . Um  So for example , um I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . Um looking from   prototyping of some des description using clay . Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh  progress . Um  The user interface design , They're kind of  it looks they're  the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , whereas  possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate , do you think ?\nMm .\nOr do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ?\nUm well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are  are made , I would say . Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . So um and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it .\nMm-hmm , that's very true .  Um . Okay . Um got product evaluation as well . Um .\nYeah , you see I don't  some of these things kinda logically follow the others . How can  t product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype .\nI I think we'd be  yeah , no , it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with .\nOh , that's the  okay , sure sure sure .\nUm so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar .\nMm-hmm .\nOr just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? Um\nOkay , sure . At this stage we still have no no target audience or\nI think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous .\n'Kay .\nUm  the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control , something that's stylish , so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying\nAnd it's stylish .\nif they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket .\nMm-hmm .\nMaybe even single , just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow .\nMm .\nAlthough of course I mean at twenty five Euros , I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device .\nYep . Okay .\nYeah .\nThink that's well within the normal bracket . Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost . U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . That one might have to be based on\nProgrammable memory as well .\nThe U_S_B_ for which ?\nFor the remote control .\nThe the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming\nOh right , okay .\ndue to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally . Um .\nWe've w definitely talking some type of\nBut didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , or are we gonna\nIt's just for T_V_ , but for\nDifferent .\nprogramming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ .\nOkay , yeah .\nI'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive .\nMm .\nWe don't know unless  it would make sense to .\nYeah ,\nBut you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something .\nI mean it's\nWell something that doesn't\nYeah .\nyou wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power .\nYeah . The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha  it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway .\nYeah .\nUm f  for one  for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be um uh I mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be um o ought to be customisable and uh\nDifferent languages , uh different skins and stuff like that .\nMm-hmm . W\nMm-hmm . How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . That sort of thing .\nSure .  I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open  it is supposed to be international , right ? So .\nIt would make sense to . I would say to .\nIt would make sense if you could\nUm and we'd better be careful about the time as well . We've already had the five minute warning ,\nOkay .\nso . Um . I would say yeah . International would make sense . Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . I'm I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say .\nYeah .\nUm looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay .  Uh we'll see how that goes . Um .\nAre we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know .\nSo um\nWhere is the clay ?\ndo  I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ?\nYeah .\nMm-hmm .\nthey're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .\nThe fruit and veg . This one .\nMm .  I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing .\nYeah , I would s that would be my my feeling .\nYeah .\nBu  but um but the spongy idea I like . I like it a lot .\nWe seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite\nYeah .\nYeah .\nI  having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well .\nYeah .\nand again this has the advantage of being harder to lose .\nSure . I mean we are trying to promote a remote control , but we wanna keep the company brand as well ,\nMm-hmm .\nYeah .\nso .\nSo we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um .\nMm . Yeah . I was  like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button .\nOkay .

So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do .\nSo uh mm I'm thin uh  I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible  things we hav we can use . Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box  would uh look look like .\nAnd how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that .\nAnd when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . Okay so can you go down uh  So , wha what I think  for now  is  we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired\nso uh I think we u we can use a battery for the  . Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the  the schema of the  o of the future uh remote controls\nDid you draw it ?\nWow .\nso uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set .\nThis  .\nThis\nWhat is the other chip for ? The one on top .\nThe one on top is for the um  well the functionali the functionalities\nOne is a communication .\nand the the th red um  sorry the green one is is to  well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to  uh to communicate with the T_V_ set .\nFor men . To the  in   Okay .\nAnd , that's it . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for  for the functionalities which is easy to to t\nMm . What is F_P_G_A_ ?\nIt's field programmable uh something array .\nGateway arrays .\nYeah .\nIt's a field programmable gateway arrays .\nSo why's it  how is it different from the Bluetooth ?\nWell , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can  pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want .\nYeah . Programme it .\nYeah  .\nOkay .\nAnd uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices .\nYeah .  Uh  So this are the  they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice\nNo . Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send .\nOkay .\nOr it's something like  isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software .\nIs the is the software par alri okay .\nYeah .\nYeah to run th to make it run .\nOkay , okay .\nThat's it .\nSo you can control  if you want , right ?\nYeah  .\nNo .\nAlright and that's it for the working design .\nSo if you have any questions ?\nMm .\nOkay , and how about the battery power ? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?\nUh no no no no , I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the\n.\nInto the\nyeah into the t .\nmore compact and uh  okay ,\nYeah , yeah .\nAnd uh I I don't think it will need um  very uh much power to make it run , so\nMm . Mm .\nYeah , yeah . Okay .\nMm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it .\nYeah . It's a good idea .\nYeah , that's right .\nYeah .\nHaving a charger rather than putting the battery cells always .\nYeah , yeah .\nYeah .\nPeople don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out .\nYeah . Mm . Uh  mm .\nWe just make a small charger\nY yeah , yeah .\nand put it\nYou can i yeah .\nBecause you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ?\nThat's a good idea .\nMa\nAlso , but but  I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote  control .\nI dunno .\nBu\nYeah we can change the b  .\nOur remote ,\nYeah .\nwe do not want to make it P_D_A_ .\nS  okay , so charger for  is the  .\nUm .\nSo is mine .\nIt's mine .

Oh we have  so let's move to to user interface design  .\nYeah .  So you can open uh\nParticipant\nthree . Yeah .  So  So I'm working on the technical functions design .  can you show the next slide . So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . So  so I found on a webs on the internet\nDuring the weekend .\nyeah .  I spent a lot of time searching\nThat's good .\nand uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set .\nMm-hmm .\nFor example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on .\nG\nSo I found two very good prototypes for  for this interface from our competitors\nso can you\nThis are usual functionality  .\nYeah , yeah , yeah . Ours is a bit uh different . So these are two example . One is from   the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah .\nTasks .\nThis is the most competing prototypes I've found  .\nBut then uh loo but then I found if you look at  you see on the left one there are too many buttons\nAnd they are small  .\nYeah . O on the right I tried to play with  the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number\nYeah .\nso it's very lousy .\nMm-hmm .\nSo you  so you move to the next the next one .\nOf course .\nYeah , so I talk about the problem . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that .\nYeah .\nSo I propose the easy to use uh prototype . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can  the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end  in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some  to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the  on the remote controller , right ?\nAnd then we  the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in  we may K_I_V_ .\nWhat do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_\nYeah , all the processing is done  the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the\nthan the\nSo we have to t\nSo we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this .\nYeah .\nWe have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too .\nYeah , we don't\nYeah because   are you just wondering what controller  okay .\nYeah , I think so . J j just the remote control .\nYeah , not the T_V_s .\nI think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that\nYeah .\nand we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah .  Okay .\nYeah , that's right .\nMm .\nSo i the processing on on the remote controller\nYeah ,\nso it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ?\nwe  . Yeah .\nMm . Okay .\nSpeech recognition .\nN yeah , that's all . The next one ? So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons .\nYes , that's a good idea , I think .\nKeep the navigation\nWe d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to  i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh\nbut\nYeah .  Yeah .\nWell , f four five buttons , it's sufficient .\nYeah . Mm .\nIt's easy to build ,\nit does not consume much power .\nYeah , that's right .\n.\nOkay , that's all .\nOh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to  if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then  .\nWell , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel\nMm .\nand then uh you  can\nMm . No , because you choose by channel , so  you choose by T_V_ program\nYeah .\nUh-huh huh huh huh .\nMaybe you\nso you don't have hundred channels to choose from . If you go by channel , you don't have to do that .\n.\nMm-hmm hmm hmm .\nbut uh I I think i i  if you if you want to to make uh  well a a big jump   but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could\nBut\nSo you are\nAh . Ah , a big jump .\nYeah then yeah that's right .\nA mouse or\nWell , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down ,\nYeah .\nwell , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or\nMm hmm hmm . Okay .\nMm .\nSo ,\nOkay .\nMm .\nwe can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .\nMm-hmm .\nHow the  this remote ?\nBut we'll see .\nUh it's gonna be small .\nYeah , of course  small .\nYeah . So it'll beep if you wanna find it\ntoo small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it .\nyou just uh shout  y h just  it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device .\nYeah ,\nthat's  .\nI dunno how bu\njust  give it a name and we call him .\nAnd  responds to you , and\nYeah , that's right .

So Harry .\nOkay , after having the inputs from  industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here .\nMm .\nAnd to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that  These are the findings which we got and  yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology  We already know that  as discussed earlier\nWell I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts\nAn  it does  how feasible it is .\nI-  mm . But I think if you  to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited  you have limited vocabulary\nOh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones .\nYeah .\nWe just have the\nMm .\nAnd this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons\nYeah .\nso it's a good idea .\nit's not going to take much space also . It's going to be very slim .\nMm . Mm .\nAnd next one was the size of the remote control . It has to be of course a very slim and small one . And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive ,\nMm-hmm .\nMm .\nso this is an important criteria here is\nBut\nBut do you think what they sug suggested s possibility  .\nMm .\nI mean we have to look for a trade-off .\nYeah .\nThe features and the cost .\nI no  I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost .\nYeah .\nMaybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort ,\nLittle bit more if it's with extra features .\nIt\nYeah .\nYeah .\nyeah , extra features .\nYeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think\nOkay .\nMm .  Yeah .\nYeah , yeah . That's right .\nBut is it useful or not u I don't know .\nWell , uh\nThere is  in the\nI mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes .\nMm .\nOr they say movie name  or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .\nMm .\nMm .\nMm .\nSo , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .\nwe we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well  yes a microphone into the the remote control , so\nMm , I think\nI  well\nI think i\nit will be alright .\nIf it's necessary can  you can do that .\nWhat is the teletext ? Mm .\nWe can integrate small microphone in the remote\nYeah .\nso it's not really a problem .\nOkay .\nWhat about lighting adaptive options ?\nYeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but  I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required .\nAccording to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . Yeah .\nIt is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller .\nMm .\nSo you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? It's very complex .\nI mean\nYeah , I think it's a bit complex too\nI mean  yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not .\nMm .\nFor our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment  light\nI think\nYeah , then we can conclude that .

Price .\nMm .\nAnd the lighting adaptation\nMm .\nand the teletext . And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions .\nOkay .\nIf you are watching an foreign movie , you get  subtitles sometimes .\nYeah .  Okay .\nAnd uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French .\nMm .\n.\nAnd if I am a German then I would like to have the  my options in German .\nSo , the remote  it should have some  it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages .\nFunction .\nThat should be a good uh point .\nYeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ?\nI think we we can we   is the  .\nYes . Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh  about a way to to access the internet via the television .\nMm .\nBecause if\nUsing the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand\nYeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet .\nYeah .\nYeah , okay .\nSo it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a  w which will c which will come in a few years .\nWe already have some  .\nSo if we already have it in our remote control\nSo you have to anticipate the the future ?\nYeah .

J_ and J_ , okay .\nJane and Jane .\n'Kay guys , take it away .\nTake it away .\nHi .\nUm , this was our first concept . We decided to use a single touch-screen . So , we've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff . And um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed .\nSo , we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning . No ? This uh isn't nothing .\nIdea maybe uh is better .\nUm well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand , so it's just gonna hold it easily .\nAnd it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too , of course .\nSo we began uh working out a concept .\nYeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . We have the  more advanced menu uh setting right here . We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . We made a top  oh , or a front view . Just so like you wanna uh back view . As you can see , this uh  there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it .\nThis is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . And uh this is for the artistic effect .\nWell , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture  later on  you have more b a better idea after that . But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh  with these two .\nHmm .\nAnd so when you put it on the table , it will just  lay down . It won't  uh roll around or stuff . But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old uh phones .\nMm .\nY you you may get the idea . So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , like we discussed early on . Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round .\nYeah , the panel just uh of course goes like this .\nYeah .\nBut the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff .\nNo , okay .\nOkay .\nAnd uh , in these bumps you could actually uh  put some electronics uh that would  you can make a more thinner uh design ,\nYeah .\nand that would actually look very nice , yeah .\nYeah .\nAnd uh , about the colour , what have\nYeah . Oh , we added that this um can be held with your hands for this  maximum is om yeah , one and a half centimetres . So , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips . S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some  have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip .\nOkay . Hmm .\nYeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh\nYeah .\nOh yeah . Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . It uh  you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us .\n'S l  it's like an uh Easter egg .\nYeah .\nYeah , it's like an e but this is for children . We we want a more adult version . But , this is like a remote control for children .\nIt's called a weemote\n. A weemote .\nWeemote .\nWeemote .\nYeah . Hey , that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand .\nYeah .\nUh , but\nWait what I w got in mind .\nSo this actually basic the idea . We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this .\nYeah , I can imagine that .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . Those are the technological colours actually ,\nYeah . It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,\nso it d\nso the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple ,\nOr blue or whatever .\nbut when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible ,\nHmm .\nthey think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh\nHmm . Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop .\nWell , um I think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen .\nYeah , okay . Yeah , okay .\nSo , there must be some cheap standard cover , um maybe white or something ,\nHmm . Mm .\nthat's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .\nYeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people .\nOui okay .\nUh , we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it , uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard ,\nOkay . The other way around , you mean .\nOh yeah .\nand for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that .\nUh-huh .\nThey want uh   they want more luxury stuff ,\nYeah .\nbut they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that .\nMm-hmm .\nSo , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .\nOkay .\nYeah .\nYeah . Yeah , maybe  yeah , perhaps you're right . Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical .\nOkay , yeah .\nAn another idea . Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style .\nYeah .\nThey'll please the elder users as well .\nYeah .\nWell yeah , a colour of  a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours .\nYeah .\nAnd lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much .\nNah . Yeah .\nYes . Not not too uh  yeah .\nThis is banana and mango , not not purple or p orange and yellow .\nYeah , exactly .\nYeah . But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours .\nYeah . Or blue or\nNot too , but w a little ,\nAh . Mm-hmm .\nbecause that's our aim .\nYeah ,\nYeah .\nli like like this like this .\nYeah .\nThis isn't this isn't too much , is it ?\nYeah , okay . No . Yeah .\nI f\n.\nWell , the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of\nYeah .  The buttons ,\nWell I I I think so .\nI\nYeah , except for the buttons it's  it could be a standard model .\nyeah .

Yeah , you can ch That's in a menu .\nIt's it's not\nSo , it's w yeah , it  it it\nyeah , it\nit isn't entirely unclear ,\nJ\nbut  So , I wouldn't give it a seven .\nNo .\nI would give it a more a five or a six .\nYeah .\nFive ?\nUh , I don I don't know .\nOkay .\nWhat do you think , uh Mister Project Manager ?\nYeah , it's it's  yeah .\nOh , okay . Well , I agree . I was thinking very black and white .\nHmm .\nBlack and red .\nYeah .\nThank you J_ .\nOkay , don't forget to save it . Uh\nRed . Okay . Volume . The remote control is easy to be found .\nUh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah\nFruity .\nand\nYeah , it has these  all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape .\nYeah .\nSo , if you so if you have  trouble finding it\nBut , um it it's not making any sound uh ,\nhave we deciding ?\nOh , okay ,\nSo\nbut  If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?\nIt'll make a difference . We have the better re  I don't know . Yeah , I think so . My remote control's black .\nA li little bit maybe ?\nA little bit , but  yeah .\nYeah . Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark .\nFour ?\nUh\nFi\nSo , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing .\nK yeah .\nI\nFo fo yeah fo five is  .\nAh , I I I think five . It's it's  it doesn't really make a lot of\nWell , then uh then I'll go for four .\nFour ?\nBecause uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false .\nYeah , okay , you're right .\nUh ,\nYes , but five is between four and six .\nI think\nso I'll I'll go for four .\nAh , you must see it as uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think .\nWha\nYeah .\nB_ .\nYeah . Yeah .\nYeah , that that's a better question actually .\nYeah ,\nExa I think that that's what it's about .\nYeah .\nit  it's\nIf your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ?\nIf it  if this lying on your couch , you're you're  you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing .\nYeah , yeah .\nSo\nBut but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it .\nYeah .\nYeah , that's stupid .\nLike , no not uh not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something .\nOkay .\nUh , but when you lost it you're just not\nBut , okay .\nWell , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange .\nThat's our remote control .\nYeah , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it's under your\nYeah , okay . Yeah , I I agree , I agree .\nYeah . Yeah , what is that . Uh ,\nMost of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . Uh\nso it's\nOkay . Eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .\nTrue .\nUm I would call uh  choose two ,\n'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not  .\nYeah , yeah , not too flashy .\nYeah .\nThe remote control is made of soft material .\nUm ,\nYeah , rubber , is kind of soft .\nYeah , but not too soft we have decided .\nkinda soft , but but not this  . Yeah .\nThree ?\nThree , yeah .\nYeah . Yeah yeah , easy to use ,\nEasy to use . One .\nvery afford .\nEasy to use ?\nYeah , can it be zero ?\nWell ,  I don yeah , it is kind of\nTop easy to use ?\nIt\nIt's it's not the most easy to use\nNo , you can do two , because um\nNo . Uh\nIt can be easier .\nit can be easier . But then you're l\nIt could  yeah .\nJus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest .\nyeah , but then you'll lose\nYeah .\nfunction f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so .\nFunctional ability .\nYeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button\nBut  It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .\non t  Yeah , okay , but easy n not not the most easy to use , I think .\n.\nNo .\nNo , it's it  I I'll go for two . My vote's on two .\nTwo ?\nOkay , two . Yeah , two .\nYeah , m mine too .\nWe also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays . So\nYeah , but waits just a minutes . Inspiration .\nWhat's the time ? We also have uh to do the evaluation , uh the production costs and uh stuff .\nThese are the m regular remotes .\nYeah yeah , I'm uh hurrying .\nOkay , eleven .

Very multifunctional .\nNo .\nThe remote control , i it has speech recognition .\nFalse .\nYes ,\nFalse .\nit\nThis is used with speech recognition , this .\nThe remote control has built-in games ?\nYes . But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh  it's not an entire game .\nYeah , but they are built in , so it's one .\nYeah , they are built in .\nYeah , okay .\nYeah .\nOkay .\nNot down .\nAnd the last , paren  parental advisory function .\nYou really like the parental advisory .\nYes .\nFreak .\nYes ,  I do .\nTh did you make this or the\nBu\nSave as .\nYeah , he made it .\nYeah ,   It changes it maybe .\nOkay , I will uh\nOh yay .\ndo the the math .\nOh dear .\nNow it's your turn .\nOkay , thank you .\nWe'll see .\nHmm ?\nMm .

No .\nWell , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved .\nUh , can I uh I say something ?\nMm , single-curves .\nYeah .\nNo , can I say something uh as Project Manager ?\nYeah , of course .\nYeah .\nThe kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,\nJust cut off the kine yeah .\nbecause uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative .\nOr\nYeah . Okay , sure .\nyeah .  Yeah , we just put a good battery it it .\nYeah .\nMobile phones nowadays .\nYeah .\nDaniel . Daniel ,\nYo . Sorry ,\nwhat do you think about  Here .\nyeah , yes .\nWhat do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station\nYeah .\njust apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh\nMm-hmm .\nrechargeable batteries in it and just\nOkay .\nBut you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .\nYeah , and not really  .\nYeah , yeah , okay .\nBut we  if you forget about the kinetic ,\nJust an idea .\nYeah , that's a cost reduc\nYeah , sure .\nYeah .\nwell if we do that , we shall  .\nAh .\nOkay ,\nSo um\nwell you you can go from double-curved to single-curved .\nYeah , of course .\nAnd that would solve the budget problem .\nUh , b but i but the single-curved is just  oh\nYeah , so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then\nYeah .\nNo , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or\nIt's just  yeah well , the single-curve that\nOh , okay , okay .\nYeah . Exactly , yeah .\nSo that's wh tha that's one option .\nOr are these two curves ? Uh\nYeah .\nAnd then w yeah , and then we could have it , but uh  it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look .\nYeah ,\nYeah , but what else uh do we have to cut out ? No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem .\nWe going to cut\nNo , tho uh that that can be done .\nYeah .\nSo uh ,\nAlthough , can we make it with a regular chip ?\nokay , a little less uh conversation .\nCurvy .\nHey , those ar arcs , why are there for ?\nSorry ?\nThe blue blue uh\nFill in   Just a\nExplanation .\nOkay .\nexplanation .\nTwelve fifty .\nI can delete it for you if you want .\nWell\nNo , no no .\nSo , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro . And we're done .\nYeah , but does it fit with our design ?\nUh well , the only uh thing that don't\nDo we have to u adapt it ? It's single-curves .\nYeah , single-curved , but there's a curve in it . So\nYeah .\nW Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we're uh has\nYeah , we just make it flat .\nOkay .\nBut , you do l\nBut , wha 'Kay , look , what is the uh  If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more .\nMore . Yeah . You make it optional .\nBut  No , but does it have a lot of extra uh\nFunction .\nFunctional .\nfun function more like\nWorth , does it have added worth ?\nUh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .\nYeah .\nNo , um\nYeah , it's really a static value . Yeah .\nYeah , uh aesthetic . I mean , uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . But  I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price .\nYeah , it is . Oh .\nYeah , well let's assume it is .\nNo , we can't go above that .\nWe we should assume it i that it is .\nYeah ?\nYeah , okay .\nYeah .\nBut I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .\nYeah , okay . Then it's okay .\nR if you uh promote a kinetic um  I  kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an  a normal remote control .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nDo you think ? Well , now you can shake your remote  control .\nYeah , I think so .\nNo , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic .\nKinetic .\nYeah .\nYou have standard old battery control uh remote con\nYeah .\nYeah .\nWhat a what about all the m the environment freaks ?\nYeah , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So\nNot freaks ,\nthe envi No .\nTrue .\nI I think it's it's  It look like this one .\nYou ma can make an an especialised extra gold version .\nYeah ? Who  because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat ,\nand I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise\nYeah .\nthing .\nYeah .\nAnd if you make the single curve ha just a big curve ,  then it's uh then it's uh\nYeah , just one big curve .\nyeah , one big good curve .\nI was going to uh say nasty words , but I don't .\nThis is strange by the way .\nWood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . We thought that wood would be more expensive .\nYeah .\nUh , this uh American figures . You just cut down some trees .\nYeah , maybe . But uh that  this is this is it ? Yeah . Okay , this is it .\nThis is it .\nWhoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium .\nI'm gonna save it . Yeah .\nYes .\nIt is possible , but you can't use double uh curves for titanium .\nNo .\nThat's one of the functionability uh\nOkay , well , considering we have\nAh no , we have to do all those hours again .\nGo back .

Uh , some uh things . Were there uh room for uh  was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?\nUm\nHmm . I I didn't think so . That  there was a lot of room for it . But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us .\nYeah .\nIt was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff .

I notice it too .\nBut\nI was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the\nAbout me .\nabout the first meeting .\nSo , uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh\nTry to learn from your mistake .

Now you you must push a little while .\nYeah , but but draw something uh difficult .\nYeah , but us\nD uh just write your name right now .\nYeah .\nTry to write your name ,\nOkay .\nin in writing letters , of course , yeah ? Yeah , normally , uh this uh  the w Block letter sign it , yeah ?\nO Just uh\nJust just write your name in in one line .\nokay .\nIf it's a little bit too small   bit quicker now .\nYou can be  you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it .\nIt didn't  Uh he he knows how it works , yeah .\nOh .\nI follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , so I think that's the that's the main issue .\nOkay .\nUm , so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with ,\nMeans .\num the the the the digital pen .\nY well , yeah . Th the i The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh\nOkay . Yeah .\nDigital pen , I thought uh th the first time I did individual work , I used it .\nYeah .\nBut , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting .\nNo .\nYeah .\nNo , I have it working . But , uh yeah , well uh\nIt's it's not real real use for me .\nNo , it doesn't have that much added value to the\nHuh . Well\nNee . As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago , it  I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must um  Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner .\nYeah .\nI it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow .\nM yeah . Yeah . And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word .\nYes . No , and it doesn't give any added value .\nNo , uh that's true . No .\nNot really , no .\nAnd uh the SMARTboard is uh useful , but the the pen is I uh   not user-friendly , I think .\nYeah , not user-friendly .\nYeah .\nBe it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,\nYeah , and it's it's not very precise .\nand that's the\nWe're trying to m to\nYeah , like when you do this .\nYeah , it may um  Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah . Smaller .\nSmaller ?\nYeah , smaller . Just like when you're writing on a letter .\nYeah , but that's not th the the  you  when you  at a foreign audience , you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small .\nNo , a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one . It's uh th it it   Yeah , uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it's almost impossible to get clear uh  when you're uh\nYeah .\nOh . Sorry .\nBut maybe there's some function with  no , it isn't . With uh\nAnd the eraser was another problem . It w t is is this large .  And when you try to erase this line , y\nYeah . Well , I'm gonna erase my uh name .\nI'm gonna erase my name there .\nYeah , it's a big uh big eraser .\nOkay . New ideas ?\nM Abo What kind of new ideas ?\nUm  Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh\nDo you ?\nYeah , uh\nGo on .\nI'm just uh\nNew ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or\nYeah . Mm , yeah , I think so .\nI don't know what what I mean .    No .\nHello .\nDid you heard what he said ?\nKnow what I mean .\nI don't  I don't know what I mean .  Oh , I have some figure .\nHere .\nOh .\nThe eva the evaluation ,\nOh yeah .\nthe mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six .\nThat's interesting .\nSo that's fairly uh fairly good , I think .\nOkay ,\nYeah .\nbecause what does it mean ?\nSo true .\nUh , that uh\nAll the mo yeah , are between one and two .\nall the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep .\nYeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Thank you , expert .\nBut the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software ?\nNot really , just they have to improve it .\nNot really , yeah ?\nUh , the concept is okay ,\nYeah , I think\nbut it has to be quicker . Uh , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process\nYeah .\nand it , yeah , just takes too many time . People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and\nYeah . You had expected it to to be uh more more uh\nMore user-friendly .\nYeah .\n'Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally ,\nYeah .\nYeah .\nand you do\nMay maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here .\nYeah .\nAnd draw it , and it's it's placed over there .\nYeah .\nYeah , that l\nYeah .\nWould be easier . Or at least when you   you don't have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen .\nHmm ? No .\nAnd that's a very bad concept .\nYep , yep . Yeah , that's true .\nAh , very bad .\nNah , okay , I I  it's my opinion that I\nBut  I think this is better than regular flip-overs , but\nYeah , it's can be saved easier .\nYeah .\nBut if you're in normal flip-over  you  a lot of people write text . There's no text option .\nYeah .\nAnd writing text  uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some\nYeah , and and maybe some uh functions for uh  uh uh circle or uh a square . You have to draw it yourself now .\nYeah . Or maybe even insert picture .\nYeah .\nIf you have uh some presentation , and you have some f\nYeah .\nOr text function . Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMean\nYeah , but insert image isn't available ?\n'Cause then you could\nHere . Picture from scanner , clip-art .\nYeah , that that can be done already .\nOh , okay .\nBut not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh\nSo you can\nHyperlink ? Hey , what if you do like hyperlink ?\nWith uh W_W_ dot Google dot com .\nType type it ?\nOh yeah . Maybe  .\nRe Real Reaction dot N_L_ .\nHmm ? Sorry ?\nYes , is  now is okay . Okay ?\nYou'll just make a link in  Yeah .\nHuh .\nWell , that's nice .\nThere's one way to uh\nIs it\n'Kay , double-click it .\nMaybe if if you're not using the eraser\nHere . oh . Oh , sorry .\nYou're erasing .\nSomething else th Yeah , arrow .\nYeah . Here , that .\nDouble-click it .\nOkay .\nSo you have\nWell , it's\nas you saw , you have a little uh  Oh , you can  Yeah , thank you . You can go uh\nYeah , okay .\nthere . So there the the the functionality is there , but it's not it's not ideal ,\nBut\nand it's it's very\n.\nit costs a lot of time to uh\nTo use , yeah .\nto use . And that's a pity ,\nYeah .\nif you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things ,\nYeah .\nand we are now with four people ,\nAnd that's m\nbut it  well , imagine you are here  you're with the ten people and everyone uh\nThat's mostly the case , from the  over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case ,\nYeah .\nand if you have to do all this kind\nTwo minutes of drawing , yeah .\nYou'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance .\nYep .\nYeah .\nAnd th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use a flip-board .\nYeah .\nWhat I really miss also is uh\nis a d is a turtle\nis a decision uh decision system like um  With the evaluation , you have to Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two ,\nYeah yeah .\nYeah .\nmaybe a a l a little application like uh uh  give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .\nYeah , just like he said with the with the  a screen which you can write , also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism .\nYeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application .\nOh .\nYeah .\nJust a little group group decision application .\nYeah .\nBut uh ,  problem is , well you can't discuss anything  well you you ca uh you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . We  I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three .\nYeah .\nBut , well uh I  we said  uh , no I w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react uh on it .\nYeah , okay .\nBut if you you put a three on it , uh just  figure well , everybody knows what I'm knowing , so they'll all just put a two on .\nYeah , of course . But , uh you can still discuss about it ,\nYeah , but it would   yeah .\nbut but click it in an application , that's a lot easier to process .\nYeah okay , the  for processing part .\nThe digit . Yeah .\nBut then uh , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it , that uh isn't that bad idea , actually .\nYeah .\nNot that your opinion isn't valued , but but still .\nYeah .\nYeah . Okay , so\nOkay .\nOkay .\nYo , manager .\nThat's it ?\nUh well , just about ,\nWhen are w\nbecause uh\nWhen are we going to produce it ?\nYeah , tomorrow ? Uh , the costs are within the budget .\nCelebration .\nUh , the project is evaluated .\nYeah .\nBut , before we going to celebrate , uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer ,\nYeah .\nbecause uh there must be some kind of end report . I am busy with the end report right now . You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh\nWhat is an end report ?\nUh about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r r a report of this day .\nYeah . Yeah , yeah .\nUh , that must be made , but I don't know ,  here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is\nOh , you ha you have ten minutes left , I uh read .\nOh .\nYou have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .\nOkay well , that uh that can be done . Maybe we can do it uh together . You can see what I've uh  yeah ?\nYeah .\nSo I I s I will uh put it on a story-board .\nYeah , sure .\nYou can see it . Because I think it will uh it must be uh\nUm  You you already made a beta version , or\nYeah , it's a three uh  with seventy five uh\nPages .\nYeah , just about .\nY yikes .  Seventy five pages .\nWell , just a moment . End report .\nOkay , Daniel .\nDo you want a chair maybe ?\nA chairman .\nNo no no ,\nHey ?\nI'm just uh\nOh , okay .\nyou can s you can read it and uh  here here it is . End report .\nSo you you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ?\nWell , this not nit it\nYes .\nread-only . But it's not uh fully finished yet .\nFive minutes for finishing .\nUm , this is about the functional design , the things  yeah yeah .\nManagement Expert , you have to change that .\nOh yeah . I'm uh  when I said it , I remember I had it here .\nMarketing .\nIt's a read-only version .\nYeah , but you can save it u the  under another name .\nOh , okay .\nMarketing Expert , okay . Um about the three functions where  uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control . Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . So , this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh  yeah .\nMaybe um the\nUh\nYeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch .\nThe  Yeah .\nYou  Yeah .\nNo , you have to put  uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second\nOka okay , okay , I  I really  didn't knew that .\nOh nay , a volume changing , second .\nSo , this one's first .\nS switch , yes .\nYou go there and you go there . So , okay .\nYeah . Okay , go on .\nWell , maybe I can then do it one two three .\nYes , very good .\nOne two three .\nIf the order is in uh  is is uh important ,\nYeah . Yeah .\nthat's the word for  .\nThe order .\nUh ,\nthen the conceptual design . Uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , uh the energy , which uh turn out to be uh batteries , so that's\nYeah . Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .\nYeah , because  yeah . Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .\nSingle-curves .\nUh , the buttons\nIt's not double .\nHmm ?\nA single-curved .\nUh , it's not double anymore , eh ?\nNot double anymore .\nNo , okay .\nNay but that  this is what um\nYeah , okay .\nWas initial , the plan . The initial plan .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nAnd the the added functions like Tetris snake , it's under the parental control , the touch-screen .\nSo , it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh\nOn thing uh  One small thing uh , the added functions . Uh , was it included in the cost ? I don't think so , eh ?\nAh , it's very cheap .\nUh , it's very cheap ,\nIt's very cheap .\nyou you maybe you you you you come at uh\nNo , it's it's not very cheap , but that\nIt's very necessary .\nno , but it's a development inside corporation . Like , uh w we don't have to buy parental control . Our own people can make that , I think .\nYeah , but it still has some\nYeah .\nYeah , it it has some cost , but\nyeah . Okay , but so we can discuss that uh\nHe'll do it in his free time . So uh\nwe can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the the board of uh\nYeah .\nOf directur or directors .\nWhat's it what's the company called ? I just keep forgetting it .\nReal Reaction .\nReal Real Reaction .\nYeah .\nReal Reaction , yeah .\nYou can ask your personal\nOkay , so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh\nYeah , the end conclusion .\nYeah , okay ,\nBut uh\nthat's that's what I'm gonna write b between now .\nOkay . Still the end conclusion . That's all , I think .\nBut , i in here nothing uh\nUm , the decision to make um the buttons on the top , and the menu on the\nMm-hmm .  Yes .\non the bottom . And clearly  Yeah , touch-screen you've mentioned .\nYeah , touch-screen I've mentioned .\nYeah , but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion , I think .\nOkay .\nWhy we decided to use a flat uh L_C_D_ .\nOkay , this n yeah .\nYeah , okay , well I gonna redesign uh something now . No .\nYeah . Um\nParty party  .\nBecause I think it will  Oh , five minutes from  to finish meeting .\nOh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first .\nSave it .\nYou can't\nHmm .\nyou can select file and export and then those J_ PEG files .\nYeah , but then you had the same thing .\nWell , eight . And we have uh ,  another blank one .\nExample of children remote .\nDid we change anything ?\nOh wait . Wait .\nWow .\nYeah .\nIt's a new uh  commercial logo .\nHmm . That's a pity .\nDon't save it , aye ?\nOh , that's cool , Tim . Finish meeting now .\nUh ,\nWell , I'm I'm\nwhy are only the first five SMARTboard files\nI'm going to finish my end report .\nsaved ?\nOkay , um hereby is  the meeting is finished .\nYou declare .\nI am the one who can say that .

Um just connecting this .\nYou don't have to worry about screwing it in just\nAre we getting i Really ?\nthere you go .\nOkay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh  Uh . Okay .\nSo the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've  oh no , you can't see a thing .  Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nOh .\nAh .\nWe it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um  the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and then  um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design .\nGreat . Okay .\nSorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but\nI prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally .\nReally ? Cool .\nYeah .\nUm , should I erase this or\nDo you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down .\nOkay .\nUm I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?\nFine .  Or suggestions ?\nIs a battery like the only way of\nWell , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nYeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or\nYeah , you blow on it and i\nIn indoors .\nNo , no\nBicycle power .\nNo I meant like\nNo 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nThe battery's down and  maybe  , I dunno , solar charged ?\nI dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but\nYeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMm . Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nI think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMm .\nSo it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nMm .\nMm .\nWell yeah these , I think , we can  so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nYeah . Because we need\nI t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nYeah . Great .\nUh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nOkay , fantastic .\nOkay .\nRight , well done , Gabriel .\n.\nUm Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nWhere does it go into ?\n.\nHere ?\nYeah .\nThe blue thing .\nUh , yeah , this is getting all  .\nMm .\n.\nYeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nWell , function F_ eight .

Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nYeah .\nI mean , okay , there's\nVoice activation might not be the best .\nI would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUh .\nUm also with um with buttons ,  a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense\nRepetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nHuh ?\nor like from doing\nYeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nWell  maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .\nI don't think so .\nSo y so it's so it's so you got\nso that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of\nYeah\nMm .\nmaybe not so hard .\nMm .\nsee  have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nMaybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a\nYeah .\nLet's jus\nMaybe\nwe just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nYeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMm .\nYeah .  They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah .\nYeah .\nI'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nYeah . I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .\nYeah .\nMm .

So\nOkay .\nYeah . Sure , that's a good idea .\nI'm Catherine with a C_ . C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_ .\nOkay , and\nUh Gabriel .\nGabriel . E_L_ is it ?\nE_L_ .\n'Kay . And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_\nI am Reissa . R_E_I_S_S_A_ . Double S_ A_ , yeah  yeah .

Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically ,\nuh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now .\nI am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to\nsort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this  for the purposes of this meeting  what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things .\nBut hopefully you've been  actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna  each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation .  Um .\nMm .\nThen we're gonna  work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll  sort of conclude  anything else comes up at the end of it .\nHow long is the meeting ?\nThis meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that .\nOkay .  No problem .\nUm if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you  it's  that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can  you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't .\nUh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa ,\nI'm fine . Yeah .\nare you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here\nI uh yeah , yeah .\nor are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ?\nThink she's finishing up her presentation .\nD I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation .\nNo no .

Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nI think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMm .\nSo it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nMm .\nMm .\nWell yeah these , I think , we can  so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nYeah . Because we need\nI t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nYeah . Great .\nUh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nOkay , fantastic .\nOkay .\nRight , well done , Gabriel .\n.\nUm Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nWhere does it go into ?\n.\nHere ?\nYeah .\nThe blue thing .\nUh , yeah , this is getting all  .\nMm .\n.\nYeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nWell , function F_ eight .

Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nYeah .\nI mean , okay , there's\nVoice activation might not be the best .\nI would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUh .\nUm also with um with buttons ,  a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense\nRepetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nHuh ?\nor like from doing\nYeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nWell  maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .\nI don't think so .\nSo y so it's so it's so you got\nso that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of\nYeah\nMm .\nmaybe not so hard .\nMm .\nsee  have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nMaybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a\nYeah .\nLet's jus\nMaybe\nwe just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nYeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMm .\nYeah .  They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah .\nYeah .\nI'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nYeah . I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .\nYeah .\nMm .

Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?

It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nOh .\nAh .\nWe it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um  the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and then  um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .

Or suggestions ?\nIs a battery like the only way of\nWell , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nYeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or\nYeah , you blow on it and i\nIn indoors .\nNo , no\nBicycle power .\nNo I meant like\nNo 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nThe battery's down and  maybe  , I dunno , solar charged ?\nI dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but\nYeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMm . Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight .

Um just connecting this .\nYou don't have to worry about screwing it in just\nAre we getting i Really ?\nthere you go .\nOkay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh  Uh . Okay .\nSo the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've  oh no , you can't see a thing .  Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nOh .\nAh .\nWe it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um  the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and then  um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design .\nGreat . Okay .\nSorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but\nI prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally .\nReally ? Cool .\nYeah .\nUm , should I erase this or\nDo you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down .\nOkay .\nUm I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?\nFine .  Or suggestions ?\nIs a battery like the only way of\nWell , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nYeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or\nYeah , you blow on it and i\nIn indoors .\nNo , no\nBicycle power .\nNo I meant like\nNo 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nThe battery's down and  maybe  , I dunno , solar charged ?\nI dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but\nYeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMm . Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nI think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMm .\nSo it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nMm .\nMm .\nWell yeah these , I think , we can  so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nYeah . Because we need\nI t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nYeah . Great .\nUh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nOkay , fantastic .\nOkay .\nRight , well done , Gabriel .\n.\nUm Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nWhere does it go into ?\n.\nHere ?\nYeah .\nThe blue thing .\nUh , yeah , this is getting all  .\nMm .\n.\nYeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nWell , function F_ eight . No\nYeah , w it it just takes a wee while .\nYeah , it just takes a second uh .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remotes, designs, remote, design, powerpoint", "dialogue_id": 121}, {"text": "oh .  Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nYeah .\nI mean , okay , there's\nVoice activation might not be the best .\nI would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUh .\nUm also with um with buttons ,  a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense\nRepetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nHuh ?\nor like from doing\nYeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nWell  maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .\nI don't think so .\nSo y so it's so it's so you got\nso that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of\nYeah\nMm .\nmaybe not so hard .\nMm .\nsee  have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nMaybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a\nYeah .\nLet's jus\nMaybe\nwe just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nYeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMm .\nYeah .  They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah .\nYeah .\nI'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nYeah .

And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_\nI am Reissa . R_E_I_S_S_A_ . Double S_ A_ , yeah  yeah .

Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically ,\nuh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now .\nI am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to\nsort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this  for the purposes of this meeting  what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things .\nBut hopefully you've been  actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna  each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation .  Um .\nMm .\nThen we're gonna  work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll  sort of conclude  anything else comes up at the end of it .\nHow long is the meeting ?\nThis meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that .\nOkay .  No problem .\nUm if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you  it's  that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can  you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't .\nUh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa ,\nI'm fine . Yeah .\nare you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here\nI uh yeah , yeah .\nor are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ?\nThink she's finishing up her presentation .\nD I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation .\nNo no .

Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nI think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMm .\nSo it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nMm .\nMm .\nWell yeah these , I think , we can  so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nYeah . Because we need\nI t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nYeah . Great .\nUh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nOkay , fantastic .\nOkay .\nRight , well done , Gabriel .\n.\nUm Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nWhere does it go into ?\n.\nHere ?\nYeah .\nThe blue thing .\nUh , yeah , this is getting all  .\nMm .\n.\nYeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nWell , function F_ eight .

Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nYeah .\nI mean , okay , there's\nVoice activation might not be the best .\nI would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUh .\nUm also with um with buttons ,  a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense\nRepetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nHuh ?\nor like from doing\nYeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nWell  maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .\nI don't think so .\nSo y so it's so it's so you got\nso that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of\nYeah\nMm .\nmaybe not so hard .\nMm .\nsee  have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nMaybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a\nYeah .\nLet's jus\nMaybe\nwe just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nYeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMm .\nYeah .  They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah .\nYeah .\nI'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nYeah . I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .\nYeah .\nMm .

Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?

It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nOh .\nAh .\nWe it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um  the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and then  um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .

Or suggestions ?\nIs a battery like the only way of\nWell , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nYeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or\nYeah , you blow on it and i\nIn indoors .\nNo , no\nBicycle power .\nNo I meant like\nNo 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nThe battery's down and  maybe  , I dunno , solar charged ?\nI dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but\nYeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMm . Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight .

Um just connecting this .\nYou don't have to worry about screwing it in just\nAre we getting i Really ?\nthere you go .\nOkay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh  Uh . Okay .\nSo the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've  oh no , you can't see a thing .  Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nOh .\nAh .\nWe it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um  the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and then  um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design .\nGreat . Okay .\nSorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but\nI prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally .\nReally ? Cool .\nYeah .\nUm , should I erase this or\nDo you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down .\nOkay .\nUm I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?\nFine .  Or suggestions ?\nIs a battery like the only way of\nWell , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nYeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or\nYeah , you blow on it and i\nIn indoors .\nNo , no\nBicycle power .\nNo I meant like\nNo 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nThe battery's down and  maybe  , I dunno , solar charged ?\nI dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but\nYeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMm . Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nI think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMm .\nSo it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nMm .\nMm .\nWell yeah these , I think , we can  so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nYeah . Because we need\nI t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nYeah . Great .\nUh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nOkay , fantastic .\nOkay .\nRight , well done , Gabriel .\n.\nUm Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nWhere does it go into ?\n.\nHere ?\nYeah .\nThe blue thing .\nUh , yeah , this is getting all  .\nMm .\n.\nYeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nWell , function F_ eight . No\nYeah , w it it just takes a wee while .\nYeah , it just takes a second uh .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remotes, designs, remote, design, powerpoint", "dialogue_id": 126}, {"text": "oh .  Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nYeah .\nI mean , okay , there's\nVoice activation might not be the best .\nI would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUh .\nUm also with um with buttons ,  a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense\nRepetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nHuh ?\nor like from doing\nYeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nWell  maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .\nI don't think so .\nSo y so it's so it's so you got\nso that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of\nYeah\nMm .\nmaybe not so hard .\nMm .\nsee  have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nMaybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a\nYeah .\nLet's jus\nMaybe\nwe just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nYeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMm .\nYeah .  They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah .\nYeah .\nI'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nYeah .

And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_\nI am Reissa . R_E_I_S_S_A_ . Double S_ A_ , yeah  yeah .

Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically ,\nuh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now .\nI am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to\nsort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this  for the purposes of this meeting  what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things .\nBut hopefully you've been  actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna  each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation .  Um .\nMm .\nThen we're gonna  work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll  sort of conclude  anything else comes up at the end of it .\nHow long is the meeting ?\nThis meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that .\nOkay .  No problem .\nUm if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you  it's  that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can  you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't .\nUh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa ,\nI'm fine . Yeah .\nare you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here\nI uh yeah , yeah .\nor are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ?\nThink she's finishing up her presentation .\nD I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation .\nNo no .

Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nI think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMm .\nSo it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nMm .\nMm .\nWell yeah these , I think , we can  so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nYeah . Because we need\nI t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nYeah . Great .\nUh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nOkay , fantastic .\nOkay .\nRight , well done , Gabriel .\n.\nUm Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nWhere does it go into ?\n.\nHere ?\nYeah .\nThe blue thing .\nUh , yeah , this is getting all  .\nMm .\n.\nYeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nWell , function F_ eight .

Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nYeah .\nI mean , okay , there's\nVoice activation might not be the best .\nI would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUh .\nUm also with um with buttons ,  a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense\nRepetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nHuh ?\nor like from doing\nYeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nWell  maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .\nI don't think so .\nSo y so it's so it's so you got\nso that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of\nYeah\nMm .\nmaybe not so hard .\nMm .\nsee  have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nMaybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a\nYeah .\nLet's jus\nMaybe\nwe just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nYeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMm .\nYeah .  They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah .\nYeah .\nI'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nYeah . I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .\nYeah .\nMm .

Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?

It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nOh .\nAh .\nWe it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um  the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and then  um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .

Or suggestions ?\nIs a battery like the only way of\nWell , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nYeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or\nYeah , you blow on it and i\nIn indoors .\nNo , no\nBicycle power .\nNo I meant like\nNo 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nThe battery's down and  maybe  , I dunno , solar charged ?\nI dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but\nYeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMm . Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight .

Um just connecting this .\nYou don't have to worry about screwing it in just\nAre we getting i Really ?\nthere you go .\nOkay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh  Uh . Okay .\nSo the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've  oh no , you can't see a thing .  Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nOh .\nAh .\nWe it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um  the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and then  um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design .\nGreat . Okay .\nSorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but\nI prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally .\nReally ? Cool .\nYeah .\nUm , should I erase this or\nDo you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down .\nOkay .\nUm I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?\nFine .  Or suggestions ?\nIs a battery like the only way of\nWell , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nYeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or\nYeah , you blow on it and i\nIn indoors .\nNo , no\nBicycle power .\nNo I meant like\nNo 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nThe battery's down and  maybe  , I dunno , solar charged ?\nI dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but\nYeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMm . Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nI think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMm .\nSo it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nMm .\nMm .\nWell yeah these , I think , we can  so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nYeah . Because we need\nI t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nYeah . Great .\nUh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nOkay , fantastic .\nOkay .\nRight , well done , Gabriel .\n.\nUm Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nWhere does it go into ?\n.\nHere ?\nYeah .\nThe blue thing .\nUh , yeah , this is getting all  .\nMm .\n.\nYeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nWell , function F_ eight . No\nYeah , w it it just takes a wee while .\nYeah , it just takes a second uh .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remotes, designs, remote, design, powerpoint", "dialogue_id": 131}, {"text": "oh .  Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nYeah .\nI mean , okay , there's\nVoice activation might not be the best .\nI would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUh .\nUm also with um with buttons ,  a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense\nRepetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nHuh ?\nor like from doing\nYeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nWell  maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .\nI don't think so .\nSo y so it's so it's so you got\nso that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of\nYeah\nMm .\nmaybe not so hard .\nMm .\nsee  have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nMaybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a\nYeah .\nLet's jus\nMaybe\nwe just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nYeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMm .\nYeah .  They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah .\nYeah .\nI'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nYeah .

And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_\nI am Reissa . R_E_I_S_S_A_ . Double S_ A_ , yeah  yeah .

Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically ,\nuh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now .\nI am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to\nsort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this  for the purposes of this meeting  what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things .\nBut hopefully you've been  actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna  each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation .  Um .\nMm .\nThen we're gonna  work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll  sort of conclude  anything else comes up at the end of it .\nHow long is the meeting ?\nThis meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that .\nOkay .  No problem .\nUm if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you  it's  that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can  you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't .\nUh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa ,\nI'm fine . Yeah .\nare you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here\nI uh yeah , yeah .\nor are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ?\nThink she's finishing up her presentation .\nD I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation .\nNo no .

Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nI think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMm .\nSo it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nMm .\nMm .\nWell yeah these , I think , we can  so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nYeah . Because we need\nI t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nYeah . Great .\nUh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nOkay , fantastic .\nOkay .\nRight , well done , Gabriel .\n.\nUm Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nWhere does it go into ?\n.\nHere ?\nYeah .\nThe blue thing .\nUh , yeah , this is getting all  .\nMm .\n.\nYeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nWell , function F_ eight .

Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nYeah .\nI mean , okay , there's\nVoice activation might not be the best .\nI would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUh .\nUm also with um with buttons ,  a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense\nRepetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nHuh ?\nor like from doing\nYeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nWell  maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .\nI don't think so .\nSo y so it's so it's so you got\nso that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of\nYeah\nMm .\nmaybe not so hard .\nMm .\nsee  have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nMaybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a\nYeah .\nLet's jus\nMaybe\nwe just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nYeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMm .\nYeah .  They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah .\nYeah .\nI'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nYeah . I think we can do some really  in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .\nYeah .\nMm .

Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?

It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nOh .\nAh .\nWe it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um  the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and then  um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .

Or suggestions ?\nIs a battery like the only way of\nWell , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nYeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or\nYeah , you blow on it and i\nIn indoors .\nNo , no\nBicycle power .\nNo I meant like\nNo 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nThe battery's down and  maybe  , I dunno , solar charged ?\nI dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but\nYeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMm . Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight .

Um just connecting this .\nYou don't have to worry about screwing it in just\nAre we getting i Really ?\nthere you go .\nOkay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh  Uh . Okay .\nSo the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've  oh no , you can't see a thing .  Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nOh .\nAh .\nWe it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um  the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well  okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called  six , or something like that .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and then  um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nMm-hmm .\nAnd uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design .\nGreat . Okay .\nSorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but\nI prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally .\nReally ? Cool .\nYeah .\nUm , should I erase this or\nDo you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down .\nOkay .\nUm I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?\nFine .  Or suggestions ?\nIs a battery like the only way of\nWell , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nYeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or\nYeah , you blow on it and i\nIn indoors .\nNo , no\nBicycle power .\nNo I meant like\nNo 'cause like cha 'cause  always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nThe battery's down and  maybe  , I dunno , solar charged ?\nI dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but\nYeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nMm . Yeah .\nOne question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nHow far away is your television ?\nYeah .\nIt's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not  doesn't have to go that far ,\nUh\nWell , the thing is uh you you don't\ndoes it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nThat's true .\nYeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the  put the telephone down , and go into the other room .\nWell , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but\nHow about Bluetooth ?  Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nWhy not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nIsn't that a better signal ?\nYeah , yeah I d it sounds like you  you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nand I'm I'm not sure it's  you're gonna use it .\nMm  .\nYou know we don't need it .\nIt's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you  if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nYeah , exactly .\nyou are gonna\nBasically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nBut\nWe're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff .

Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nOkay .\nDo you need the border ?\nUh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nOkay .  Sorry .\nTechnical  . Okay .\nOkay , so , while this is warming up ,\nAdjusting .\nthere it is uh .\nYeah .\nSo I'm doing the user interface design .\nMm-hmm .\nYeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um .  we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but\nMm yeah .\nUm so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that  seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nOkay .\nUh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you  uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um  freeze frame .\nMm-hmm .\nUh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see  what's possible to do ,\nYeah .\nyou're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nGreat .\nAnd I  judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nbecause uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nMm .\nYeah .\n.\nSo uh , yeah , that's me .\nGreat . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units  stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or\nNo that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another   exists  like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nYeah .\nThat was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with  in in all my years in in the remote business .\nYeah .\nI've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that  a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nUm  I would say it's  If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nYeah .\neven if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nMm-hmm . 'Kay .\nit's  like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nRight .\nbut you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred  well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nMm  .\nYou know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nMm .\nRight . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nWe put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nI think I think we have to carry that mental .\nMm .\nSo it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control  well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nMm .\nMm .\nWell yeah these , I think , we can  so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nYeah . Because we need\nI t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nYeah . Great .\nUh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nOkay , fantastic .\nOkay .\nRight , well done , Gabriel .\n.\nUm Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nWhere does it go into ?\n.\nHere ?\nYeah .\nThe blue thing .\nUh , yeah , this is getting all  .\nMm .\n.\nYeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nWell , function F_ eight . No\nYeah , w it it just takes a wee while .\nYeah , it just takes a second uh .", "topic_id": 2, "keywords": "remotes, designs, remote, design, powerpoint", "dialogue_id": 136}, {"text": "oh .  Come on . Right . Okay .  . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave  so this is research  and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like  like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um  per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\n'Cause we've only got five channels .\nexactly .\nThat's another thing .  Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like  .\nI think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nYeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nYeah .\nYeah .\nMm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also  remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nMm .\nSo maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nWow .\nUm personal preferences .\nYou are a child of technology , aren't you ?\nUm so yeah um  I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um  has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find  , so I don't know whether maybe  and also we asked them whether they wanted   whether they'd be interested in um  voice activating .\nSo voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five  this is age , sorry ,  age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two  ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nSo there you go , yeah .\nUm  so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nUh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nNo I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nIt's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and\nWell the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent  say no , so\nPeople people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nFor people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not  sort of  most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nYeah , that would be my guess as well .\nuh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nSo they don't\nUm  d and tha\nWell\nand that's a  that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nThese guys are growing up .\nWhat about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nYeah .\nI mean , okay , there's\nVoice activation might not be the best .\nI would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nUh .\nUm also with um with buttons ,  a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense\nRepetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nHuh ?\nor like from doing\nYeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't  I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nWell  maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .\nI don't think so .\nSo y so it's so it's so you got\nso that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of\nYeah\nMm .\nmaybe not so hard .\nMm .\nsee  have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nMaybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a\nYeah .\nLet's jus\nMaybe\nwe just want  need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nYeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nMm .\nYeah .  They're having a lunch break at the moment , but  yeah .\nYeah .\nI'll see if I can get  see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nYeah .
