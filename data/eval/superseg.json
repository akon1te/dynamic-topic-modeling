            "So, she can really qualify for those and really have them then?",

            "Thanks, i just wanted to be sure. Oh, and how much will my spouse receive, given my benefit is higher, please?",

            "Well, the immediate effect would be that the benefit amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to her full retirement age. That applies if she begins to receive benefits between age 62 and her full retirement age."
