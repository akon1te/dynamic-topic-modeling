There is where you'll find a sweet spot for how many steps to perform. For example, say you start with 1000 steps, and find that at around 500 steps the model starts overfitting - the validation loss goes up (bad) while the training loss goes down significantly, meaning the model is learning the training set really well, but is unable to generalize to new datapoints. Therefore, 500 steps would be your sweet spot, so you would use the `checkpoint-500` model repo in your output dir (`phi2-finetune-viggo`) as your final model in step 8 below.\n",
